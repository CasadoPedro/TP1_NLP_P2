       " \"it so let's jump in here we have our game fully set up for our three players we'll be playing the game for the perspective of the purple player over here I've already done several pieces of setup the most important being that each player has chosen a window pattern that\",\n",
       " \"player has chosen a window pattern that they've slid into their frame we each got two of these double-sided cards to choose from at the beginning of the game and then once we picked one we got to see down here the number of little dots this is how many favorite tokens we\",\n",
       " 'this is how many favorite tokens we start at the beginning of the game we see that blue has five we have four and red has three and these are correlated with the difficulty of the pattern itself so this pattern over here is easier than this one which is why the',\n",
       " \"easier than this one which is why the blue player got a couple more of these tokens and we're going to spend these tokens over here on these tools which let us do various cool things as we place Dice and move them around on our little patterns we also have three public objectives that were randomly\",\n",
       " \"public objectives that were randomly dealt out and lastly each of us was given a private objective we see that ours is blue this says that we're going to get victory points at the end of the game that equal the sum total of Pips on all the blue dice in our window we'll be\",\n",
       " \"all the blue dice in our window we'll be going first and so what we do is we grab this big dice bag and we're going to pull out seven Dice and then we're going to roll them since we rolled the dice we are first to pick and I think that what we should do is take this blue five\",\n",
       " \"we should do is take this blue five right here and put it down into our window now the first die that we put down must go into one of the perimeter spots and there are a couple uh Cardinal rules as we're playing the game the first is that when we put the D down it\",\n",
       " \"first is that when we put the D down it has to match the shade of the pattern so if I want to put this blue Dy down here that's fine because it's blue also the PIP value has to match if there is one on your board so for instance I could not put this here because that says six\",\n",
       " \"not put this here because that says six and this is a five I think let's go ahead and take this blue five uh this is good for us because well it blocks over that spot also we know that our private objective is blue so this is five points at the end of the game for us and I\",\n",
       " \"at the end of the game for us and I think that's a pretty good place for us to start we now move to the blue player and they've decided to take one of these red fives and they're going to put it down right here it's on the perimeter so that's fine and now moves over to the\",\n",

       " \"is we actually have a snake draft where we picked one blue picked one Red's going to pick two and then it goes back to blue and then finally comes back to us so the red player grab this yellow four and they want to put it down right here and at this point it's good to talk\",\n",
       " \"here and at this point it's good to talk about a couple more rules the first is that whenever you place a new die down onto your window it has to be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a previous die that you have also there are two Cardinal rules of the game\",\n",

       " 'diagonal is just fine this also brings us to a good point to discuss these public objectives this first one right here is going to give any game points for having diagonally adjacent dice of the same color and this is probably part of the reason why the red player decided',\n",
       " \"of the reason why the red player decided they want to put this yellow d right here because now this is effectively a two-point play for the end game because they have two yellow dice that aren't diagonally adjacent we are also going to get two points at the end of the game\",\n",
       " \"get two points at the end of the game for every pair of one and two value dice in our entire window though positioning does not actually matter and lastly we'll get five points for every column we have in our window that doesn't have two dice with the same color for\",\n",
       " \"two dice with the same color for probably much the same reason as the red player blue decides to grab this five and they're going to put it right down here so it is also diagonally adjacent to a red it's now finally come back to us and we have to pick one of these two\",\n",
       " \"us and we have to pick one of these two dice right here and I think that we should grab this one part of the reason for that is because it's half of a potential pair for some endgame points from this public objective and also because it works out relatively well by\",\n",
       " \"because it works out relatively well by placing right here this is a green forced shade spot right here and also if we look at the PIP values around this one we have a three a five and a two so that means we're not actually conflicting we wouldn't want to put something down that would Conflict for\",\n",
       " \"something down that would Conflict for instance if we had taken this purple four and put it here we would have a problem because we need to put a four right here and you can never have two dice of the same value so we're not going to choose this one and with that\",\n",
       " \"going to choose this one and with that the round is over there's always going to be at least one die remaining and we're going to take this one and put it up here onto the round tracker to show that round one is done and we can now move into round two we now hand the dice\",\n",
       " \"move into round two we now hand the dice bag to the blue player and they're going to pull out seven Dice and roll these blue starts It Off by grabbing this red six and they're going to put it right down here in the bottom middle of their window red likes the look of this green\",\n",
       " \"window red likes the look of this green four and they're going to put it down right onto this four spot for our first pick I think we should grab this red five right here uh first of all because it works out relatively well for our little pattern because we get to match\",\n",
       " \"little pattern because we get to match the five right there but also because we have a sneaking suspicion that it's possible that the blue players hidden goal is red considering the only dice that they've taken so far are red and all high value so grabbing this means\",\n",
       " \"all high value so grabbing this means it's not in the pool for the a blue pair to potentially grab on their next turn and for our second grab let's go ahead and take this four because it matches our private goal which is blue so this is four points to us right away and\",\n",
       " \"is four points to us right away and let's go ahead and I guess maybe put it over here so that we have the ability to chain off in a diagonal over there with a blue if we put this here then right from the gecko that's not great we'd kind of like to put a red down there uh\",\n",
       " \"kind of like to put a red down there uh and also it's jent to something that needs to be a two and that's no big deal for us I wouldn't want to put it over here because then we'd have two Blues in the same column and then we would lose out on Five Points at the end of the\",\n",
       " \"out on Five Points at the end of the game it's back to the red player and they decide to grab this yellow six and they'll plug it down right there and lastly blue decides to grab this yellow five and they'll put it right there the green five is the remainder so we'll put\",\n",
       " \"green five is the remainder so we'll put it up onto the track and we can now move into the third round of the game we'll pass the die bag to the red player they're going to pull seven out and roll them red of course gets the first grab and they're going to take this blue two\",\n",
       " \"and they're going to take this blue two right here which is of course half of a set for this endgame objective for getting two points and they're going to put it right into the bottom middle of their board is now our turn to grab and there are two good Blues available and\",\n",
       " \"there are two good Blues available and of course we could pick a different color dice but blue is much more attractive to us and right from the get-go this five looks great because it's worth five points at the end of the game but the problem is that we don't actually have any legal place to put it\",\n",
       " \"actually have any legal place to put it on our board at the moment because right here would be Blues next to each other right here we would have fives next to each other and the same thing goes for these locations up here and of course we can't put that there because it's yellow\",\n",
       " \"can't put that there because it's yellow so unfortunately we cannot actually uh place this die down although if we really wanted to we could activate this tool up here now let's go ahead and take a look and see the details of this it's says it is a uh grossing pliers and it\",\n",
       " 'says it is a uh grossing pliers and it says that after you draft you can increase or decrease the value of the drafted die by one and the way you activate these is by taking favor tokens and putting them down onto the cards the first time either of these tools is',\n",

       " \"make sense to sacrifice a point just to be able to flip this over to something else and put it as a diagonal when we could grab this one which is half of a pair to get two points at the end of the game and we can put it down right here where it's going to be diagonally\",\n",

       " \"it's called a egom brush and it says that we can move any one die in our window and we can ignore the color restriction that is on our window pattern of course we do have to obey all of the regular placement restrictions as I mentioned before the first time one of\",\n",

       " \"top of this purple spot which leaves us open to grab this blue five over here which is also great because it's five points at the end of the game and we can put it down into that previous location and we have the bonus of having diagonal Blues of course this costs us one point\",\n",
