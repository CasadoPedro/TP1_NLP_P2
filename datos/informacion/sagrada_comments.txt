A good midweek game. Thinky and pretty.

It is okay. Favor tokens and what you can do with it feel weird sometimes. It can be a painful experience if the colors you need never show up.

;

If you’re looking for a solid abstract game that would appeal to a variety of audiences, Sagrada is your game. It’s not going to blow you away, but it also won’t disappoint. Those who spend their time carefully thinking through their turn will typically do better in this game. There is little luck involved, all things being equal. The game is low maintenance, easy and quick to set up, easy to teach, and has high-quality and beautiful components. This game probably deserves a place on every family’s shelf.

The stunning components elevate it to a 9, but the amount of thinking it requires to make a perfect game is tiresome. I recommend playing this first, because if you play this last, it will drain you. Great for a week night and I find it better with fewer people (but throwing 10 dice at once is always nice!)

++ Very good light weigth dice-drafting puzzle game that is surprisingly "thinky" where you work with the randomness of the dice to "solve" your window pattern by trying to maximize your victory points from the game's objective cards using your tools (special action that can help you manipulate your dice).
++ The theme is still pretty well implemented for a somewhat abstract game.
++ Great replayability coming from several different window pattern cards, several different objective cards (of which only 3 are used in each game), and of course the way the dice are rolled (different color dice draw from the bag and different value value all the time). It's surprising how a different combinaison of public objectif cards and tools can change a game.
++ Great components: The player boards are great, with recess spots for the dice and with a nice glossy finish; the dices are great looking; the dice pouch is beautiful and the glass tokens are nice. These component really give this game a nice table presence and a nice tactile feel.
++ The solo game is really fun and challenging. It's a simple twist from the original game (not too much of rule changes) and offer a great quick and thinky solo filler game. It can take a few game to get use to it, as you control both your score and the target score to beat, but this is so much more fun than just achieving a certain score to get a ranking (anyway, your score would change a lot according to the available objectives, as some are more easily done than others).
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (and that still offer some spare room for more!).
++ Fun, easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play game.
++ There are several expansions available, which is cool if you love this game and want to refresh it.




-- It's a tiny bit more luck-driven than I love, as at lower player count, you won't see all the dice colors equally, depending on the draw, so sometimes you are desperately waiting for a certain color that may never show up again late in a 2-player game (as we only see 50 out of the 90 dice in any game). A BGG user suggested to scale the dice according to the player count (so 10 dice of each color in a 2-player game), and I'll try that variant as it should correct this problem. EDIT: This has been implemented in the 5-6 Players Expansion.
-- This is less true for 2-players games, which is the best player count IMO, but it's sometimes hard to closely monitor exactly what your opponents are needing exactly (so it's may feel mostly multiplayer solitaire for some as there will be less "hate drafting", but this doesn't bother me much).
-- The solo mode as per the rules is too hard without any tweaks. I thus currently play with a simple but efficient HOUSE-RULE (SOLO MODE): Take Favor tokens equal to the difficulty level of the window pattern divided by 2 (rounded up). These Favor token can be spent to re-draw and re-roll all the dice you just took from the dice bag (this limit the bad draws, especially late in the game where sometimes the dice drawn cannot be place at all so you lose a lot of points while the target score increase a lot because you may be adding 3 or even 4 dice to the track).
-- If want have this game mainly as a gateway/welcoming game (like me), which this game is awesome for, you don't really need any other expansions than maybe the 5&6 Players expansions, as using any of the The Great Facades ones really complicate the base game too much for this game to stay a great gateway/welcoming game.

If it was a choice between Sagrada and Azul, I would choose Sagrada every time. There is just something much more visceral about rolling dice than picking up tiles (no matter how nice they look). It does mean there is a lot more luck involved, which might not be to everyone's taste.

;

Abstract. There's always a clearly optimal choice if you think long enough. Lots of time counting points at the end of the game. Feels like math homework.

;

Super aesthetic. Doesn't have the "negative, take that!" of Azul. Some of the "tool" cards are not super easy to use so we've added "place or move" to our own rules. I colour photocopied the window pattern cards so that we can see what the dice are sitting on during play, this helps a lot as moving the dice is fiddly

I love Sagrada. I know it's being compared to Azul, but I feel there are some differences between them.

1) It feels more puzzly than Azul. It takes careful planning and consideration in order to score a good chunk of points.

2) It has more variability with many tools, hidden quests, patterns, public quests and expansions

However Azul (the "basic" one) feels more competitive and it has a nice learning curve in order to become actually good. Moreover, the solo that Sagrada has, feels lackluster.

IMO both of them deserve to be in a collection and definetely someone should keep an eye into the 5-6 player expansion of Sagrada.

Update: The novelty kind of wore off and I find little to no reason to play games like Sagrada or Azul. And if I am in a mood for such a game, most of times, Azul is the go-to choice.

;

Great great game. Good to look at, good to play, good interaction, good solo.
What more can you want? Yes, it has variability - masses of it, so highly replayable

Świetna gra, która początkowo nie wiedzieć dlaczego wydawała mi się skomplikowana Zasad jest mało, ale za to jakie rozkminy zachodzą w czasie swojego ruchu ! Która kostkę wybrać, by nie zrobić sobie problemu na planszy. Przeklinanie pod nosem, gdy jesteśmy zmuszeni skorzystać z narzędzi by móc dołożyć do planszy kostkę, która nie jest dla nas optymalna. Oj jest to czasem wredna gra, ale nie z racji negatywnej interakcji (choć tej może być ciut przy grze na 2 osoby, gdy możemy sobie podbierać kości, które mogą interesować przeciwnika), ale gdy losowość jaka występuje w tej grze daje nam osobiście popalić. Z tego względu nie jest to gra dla każdego. Fajnie, że można do niej dokupić dodatek pozwalający zagrać nawet w 6 osób, czego np. brakuje mi w Azulu, który jest chętnie porównywany do Sagrady. Niby są to podobne gry bowiem układamy jakiś wzór by zyskać jak najwięcej punktów, ale zdecydowanie w tym względzie Sagrada jest trudniejsza od zwykłego Azula. Niemniej jest tak samo ładnie i solidnie wykonana. Mamy też insert, który być może pomieści jeszcze elementy z dodatku na 5-6 osób na co liczę. Grę polecam do wykorzystania w bibliotekach i na świetlicach szkolnych. Spokojnie dzieci ok. 8 letnie jeśli są ograne mogą zagrać pomimo, że wiek pudełko to 13+.

Notes:
November 2019-Puzzle/abstract

The game was like a 8, prior to getting the 5-6 player expansion. This expansion is a must have. I found the base game to be frustrating any chance of planning when I can’t draft the right die. Having the private dice pool fixes this. Excellent game very fun.

This is so clever. Dice as stained glass windows!! What! I'm always using Sagrada dice to play other games. For brightening up winter nights. Rules easy, few extra bits and bobs to spanner up the works so 1.5 Game play bit so interactive and mean cos you concentrate on your window so I'd say 1/2 for interaction score

;

Simple and elegant design. Your decision are important, but the rules are simple. I love the puzzle for its relaxed nature. The game can feel very solitaire during play which is ok for the short filler that sagrada is. I would compare it to a beautiful version of soduku.

;

One of my favorite games. I love the strategy of trying to fit everything together that you can to get the most points. It feels like a puzzle where you’re trying to beat the game itself as much as you’re trying to beat the other players.

The dice are BEAUTIFUL! I love that you always have different tools and scoring cards and window blueprints every game. One con that I can see is that the private objectives are a bit powerful. If you get a lot of 6’s rolled in your color, you’re objectively more likely to win.

However, I love this game and it’s one of my top picks.

A simple, almost shallow "dice" game, where dice are stand-ins for tiles and the other puzzle game implements: Sagrada is moderately fun but cannot help but feel like a puzzle game in disguise. That is, disguised as the dice game it is not.

I purchased it in the hope that my non-gaming parents would enjoy it, since they play simple games occasionally: but they still find it a little too difficult - clumsy and fiddly would be a better match - for their tastes.

In my opinion it's moderately fun but there are better games - games I enjoy more - that cover the same spot as Sagrada but do better.

;

An enjoyable game! Easy to learn - fun to play!

A good puzzle as your options shrink as the game end nears. Early decisions on where to place dice may come to haunt you then.
The cost for dice mitigation is excellent as you give up points for them but that may get you one step closer to maximizing the objectives.
Having different scoring objectives is good.
The interaction is in the way dice drafting works. Going first gets you a single dice, anything you want. But your next pick is last ... choose wisely and be aware of what other players need.
The dice drafting is key, otherwise it would be heads down.
A solid game.

;

Good relaxing visually cool looking puzzle game that still has some interaction with the central die pool and tools. It's pretty much even with Azul for us.

Only i wish they ever make a deluxe version with some led lights behind the tableau to shine through the clear dice window. Wouldn't that be epic? Maybe I'll try to make my own.

;

Played probably 4 times now. It's pretty and easy to pick up, but the challenge and strategy just aren't there for me. Its probably too simple and not biting enough to draw the competitor out of me, but I think its probably a good game for a casual game day, and its not hard to see others on. Perhaps a good "intro to board games" game

+ Very good looking componentes, especially the player board (stained glass window) and those gorgeous colorful transparent dice;
+ Great filler, or gateway game, with simple rules and attractiveness potential for hobby newcomers;
+ Lot's of expansions will bring replayability and keep the game fresh and new;

- Altough quite addictive, after some gameplays people will notice the disadvantage of less interaction.

Sagrada is, undoubtedly, an amazing abstract/family game with challenging and fun puzzles.
All my friends loved it at first look (those dice are marvelous) but, in my opinion, start to feel a bit boring due to repetitiveness (maybe I'll buy expansions in the future).

Final score 7: I would suggest it (and normally willing to play).

Have both a physical copy and the Steam version developed by Dire Wolf Digital. Regarding the Steam version, it's a beautiful rendition and I enjoy playing it. As a solo game, Sagrada is very tough. Playing it digitally helps tremendously as you don't have to worry about the adjacency rules (i.e., same color side by side, same number side by side) because the software does that for you. Overall, a great game and I'm happy I have the digital version. Regarding the physical version, I've played both Azul and Sagrada now, and while they have similar mechanics, for me they scratch different itches, so I enjoy both.

It's everything I love in a game.
It's seemingly easy but turns out surprisingly hard near the end, it requires fast thinking and on-the-go planning. It's filled with negative interaction as you pass around the dice and someone will always take the die you were planning to pick.
I love that it's easy enough that new people are not afraid to try it and it's so addictive that it makes everyone go "Again!" at the end of the game.
I recommend it to everyone, seasoned boardgamers, and absolute newbies! It's also perfect for a gift!

I really enjoy the "logic puzzle" feel of this game. I would rate it higher, but there's so few objectives to score points and even the hardest difficulty windows are pretty easy to fill out if you're thinking far enough ahead. That being said, I still haven't gotten bored of it and have found it plays well with any number of players.

The individual player boards and colored dice in this game do a great job at providing a good ambience for the intended theme. Game play is relatively straight-forward with room for strategy. Two potential downsides to consider: (1) Analysis Paralysis t's amazing how long 10 player rounds CAN take. (2) Some non-gamers I've played with struggle in trying to keep both personal and overall game objectives straight. Recommend the 5-6 player expansion as it adds another fun variant (dice wheels)that help move the game along faster.

I own and really like the entire Azul series (Queen's Garden is my fovourite) and always hesitated to buy Sagrada since it is often compared to Azul. After 8 years (!) I pulled the trigger and bought the base game. What a beautiful looking game! And what a disappointingly boring experience to play... You might as well play Sudoku, on your own...
Luckily, it is possible to upgrade the game a bit to your liking. I got the 5-6 player expansion, which makes the game-play faster and a little less awkward; especially when playing with 2 (!!! interesting, since it's a 5-6 player expansion, remember?)
Then I also got the Glory expansion which makes the game more interactive. Instead of just trying to reach your own personal goals you now also race for common goals, try to reach secret, hidden goals (Ticket to Ride style) or do better at scoring certain goals than your competitors. It makes it all a bit more a social experience of playing together.
I would say the game now gets to a 7.3, l little less than the Azul games. And yep, I spent quite some money to get there. But it has a beautiful table-presence!

Very visually satisfying with the translucent dice and the window boards. Doable to teach to newcomers, though might create some confusion for them (like placement restrictions), so be aware. Plenty of variety between the tools and the objectives, the private objectives in the base game can be somewhat luck-based (due to focusing on colour), so whenever possible I'd recommend using private objectives from one of the expansions instead.

;

Knocking down the score because Sagrada should have better private objectives without having to buy an expansion I won't use since I play it as a 2 player game.

Love this game. Love the dice.

Dice drafting and placement with (hidden as well as visible) objectives. It's nice components are not great, as I've heard people cry online (cards are medium quality, the dice are ok quality, the glass beads and the window frames being the only ones that are indeed nice very nice looking. The gameplay is simple and it's a great gateway game for anyone (the power cards being the only advanced elements in the equation). All in all, a nice game but not the jewel people have led me expect.

This one has not aged well for me. Just recently played it again for the first time in a long time and it's going on the sell pile. It's pretty but I'm not a huge fan of the how the tools work (in how they go up in price) and the private goals aren't fair considering it's a dice game with minimal mitigation.

From the first experience and through mid 20s in the play counts, this game still feels unlike any other game in terms of the blend of its mechanics and theme, presentation and experience.

Good brain-burner.
Can be very frustrating in the last rounds, but that's part of the charm.

;

Sagrada is a solid, straightforward game. It's a pretty basic drafting game with an extra level of randomness due to the significance of the numbers rolled on the dice. Because most goals involve drafting high numbers focusing on either a single color or specific positions, the general strategy remains roughly the same. If more unique and interesting goals were added, I think it would improve the game a lot. Something like that might have knock-on effects on how frequently players step on each other's toes, which could be a positive or a negative.

In any case, the game is approachable, and the 6 player expansion makes it a decent large-group experience. Replayability is low in my book, and that's its biggest drawback.

Sagrada is a puzzly game that plays fast and has a very simplistic ruleset.
The way you score points is also pretty straightforward.
Just like in the game Azul, you have to look what other players need in order to prevent a pass on your turn. This game has a very clean and beautiful design.

Negative points?
You don't really care about what other players accomplish, you are just placing dice in order to gather points which are calculated at the end of the game. There is not really a noticeable tension.
It may be a me-problem, but I am still wondering why any player would prefer a harder difficulty configuration above an easier one?!
The argument of having more tools at your disposal seems not worthwhile, at least, not to me.

Would I recommend Sagrada as a must have in an experienced board game collection? No, I would not.
Would I recommend Sagrada for a couple of plays? Yes, for families who just want to play very light fillers games, this will work just fine.

The boardgame community recommends this as a 2-player game.... I'm a bit confused... with 3 players this game is a lot more challenging to play and I have therefore upped my rating a little bit.

Left feeling a little cold. Not friendly with my red-green color-blindness, which isn't surprising

It took a long break from the game and having the ability to stop comparing it to Azul, but I think something finally clicked the last time I played it. It's a lot of fun in it's base format and we'd been playing it with the expansion a lot. I do like how the expansions can be used in so many different ways when needed to keep it fresh. Solid staple game. (11-2024 update)

30 min dice placement. Reminds me of sudoku. The tool cards haven’t made a difference in a game yet.

Pretty Game, easy to get people to play, but the more I play it the more I find that, more often than not, the correct play is to just pick the highest value die you can, and that ultimately winning depends on whether your hidden color was rolled high or not. This is especially true in two player games, which I do not enjoy playing at all.

;

Simple and gorgeous.

2-4 игрока

;

Couple of 2-player games so far, one 4-player game. Everyone pretty focused on their own board and not much player interaction apart from "oh no, they took the dice i needed" and that's it. Might become fun with more plays and in depth thinking of how to maximize points with the given goal cards, but not very exciting during the first couple plays, so i doubt we'll get to that point; Good visual presentation though. Christmas presents for wife, new, €30

;

A nice little filler game that literally everyone can play. Good room for skill expression because it's a drafting game and you can assess other player's positions.

Takes a little too much time for what it is.

;

Nice game! BUT IT IS A NIGHTMARE WHEN THE DICES SUCK!

;

Wow effect - 0.9/1.0 - First time you see it, you'll fall in love with it. The player boards are so elegant and cute in the same time.
Overlength - 0.9/1.0 - Just right amount of moves to let you feel you could complete your goals. But sometimes you just wait too long only for one small move.
Replayability - 1.2/1.5 - There's enough card goals combination to keep replayability high. But the feel of gameplay is not much different from game to game.
Strategy depth - 1.1/1.5 - You need good visualisation. Abstract enough, to be able to react on dice, which are random. But there's nothing like after 5 plays of Sagrada you still exploring the winning paths.
Theme - 1.0/1.0 - really nicely match what you're actually doing.
Production quality - 1.5/1.5 - double-layer board in retail edition, beautiful dice.
Interaction - 0.7/1.0 - every player is focused on its board, but if you want be interactive, you can grab a dice the next player wants
Easy to learn - 1.3/1.5 - for family game, it's just fine. There are some placement rules which people always forget, but that's nothing

Got this pretty recently and have played it a handful of times already. I'm really liking this game as a light weight or even gateway board game. It feels like Azúl but not as cut throat and you don't often get stuck with dice you can't/don't want to take. There's enough variety with the tool cards and public objectives to balance out the color of the dice being pulled and the numbers rolled. Highly suggest you play this if you have the chance to.
*Edit; I'm bumping my rating to a high 8. It's one of my most played games and I always enjoy it. It's my go to "entry level tabletop experience."

We keep finding ourselves going back to this game because it tickles a fun part of my brain that’s slightly analytical. The strategy is pretty quick to learn and is easy to play.

The game is fun to play multiple times in a row since it plays pretty quickly. There are several objective and strategy cards to choose from so each game is different.

Note: I also have the 5-6 player expansion


Original comment in 2017: Puzzle games aren't my favorite, so I'm not that enthusiastic about this one. It's pleasant to play, and replayability is high due to different scoring objectives and in-game resources. It's very multiplayer solitaire.

;

Has a bit more depth than you'd expect and has quite the visual appeal. My gf and I enjoy this game whenever we want a quick puzzle that doesn't outstay it's welcome.

;

The different public objectives and special abilities provide a nice bit of variety from one game to the next
Visually appealing
While the game is simple and straightforward, the choices can sometimes be pretty tricky

While the existence of private objectives is nice, it would've been cool to see some more variety there as well - and maybe give everyone two to pick from?
Since you don't use your player color for anything except scoring, it's trivially easy to lose track of which score marker is which player's if you score one objective at a time

Sagrada is an awesome game that often gets compared to Azul. They are both great and there is room for both on my shelf. A thinky, puzzly abstract that looks great and plays great. And despite being an abstract, I think the theme shines through pretty well. The variety of different ways to score allows you to have an idea of how you and your opponents are doing, but not exactly. A steady stream of enhancing and modular expansions continue to elevate this game. There are a number of ways to play with variety in this game that keep it fresh. One of the best all-time in my book, and one that will stay on my shelf forever.

Beautiful game. Tons of variation with the different powers. Simple and easy-ish to teach. This is a puzzle to figure out and you have to do quite a bit of forward thinking, but that's also what I love most about it. Depending on the numbers or colors that come out of the bag, your strategy can change on the spot and you have to be adaptable. The player powers allow for variation and a few more options to maybe alter things that you couldn't have forseen at the time. Love this game and the theme/beauty of it adds to it.

In collection: 2020 October
Why did I buy it: Recommended game to play with young kids that is still loved by adults.

Kid age sweet spot: 5+

Played 2 games with 5 year old son without tools card to explain the dice placement to him and it went well! I will introduce tools progressively.
Played one "real" game with my wife and she beat me 51 to 50, so this game is a keeper! There is a decent amount of luck but it doesn't bother me in this game because there are interesting decisions and it is short. Playtime was 30 min for a first 2-player game, so it will see a lot of playtime I think.
Played a few solo games with official rules but did not enjoy it that much because the feeling of the game is very different than multi-player. I was looking for solo variants and was not super excited by any of them until I found the automa version here:

It's really good!

It's a game that I'd more or less forgotten about until I played Sagrada Artisans - that game annoyed me but made me appreciate the elegance of the regular game.

TOP 10

A really nice and relaxing game.

Thus far I’ve tried dice pools only once, and that addition made the game much more thinky.

Personally I like snake draft and the luck aspect of the base game — at least with two players. I’ve played the base game more than 100 times.

I tend to like game expansions but I could have gone without Sagrada’s expansion materials. The only expansion I’d repurchase is 5-6 expansion to get more window cards, an option to play with more players and a different play style for larger groups.

A quick score the most points abstract/math game. Player interaction is low which will likely prevent it from being rated higher. Overall well produced, with clear rules, that is fun to play if you are in the mood for a puzzle game. Kickstarter edition.

Fun game but I actually enjoy the digital version more. We have found 3 players to be the sweet spot for us.

Don't be stupid when placing cubes, and then see who got the luckiest cube placements when the game ends. Don't find the game rewarding or fun.

The puzzle is fun, the various objectives enjoyable to finish. Best to play with people who don't like screwing others over.
Biggest negative it is practically broken in scoring. Big flaw is the OP nature of private goals that swing games no matter what, the total uselessness of special abilities and no extra points for the finished board. The point system needs a redo.. just like Azul it shapes gameplay and can easily take away from a good puzzle. Azul is better balanced while this is more fun at its core.

Players are artists competing to create the most beautiful stained glass window in the Sagrada Familia using dice representing glass pieces with colors and shades (dice values). Over 10 rounds, players will draft dice to place on their windows following the placement rules of their frame. Since all the frames are different, everyone will have slightly different goals each game. It is a fun little optimization puzzle with both public and private goals that I enjoy bringing out occasionally.

Great at first, but becomes very samey very fast.

Nice little pattern filling optimization game.

;

A dice drafting, set collection, pattern creation game with "Public Objectives" (bonus points for creating certain types of patterns or sets), cards that help you mitigate unfortunate dice rolls or allow you to occasionally bend the dice placement rules, and a "secret goal" for each player. The game is played in 10 rounds.

It's a beautiful, colorful game, it's fun to toss dice, and it's absorbing. As the game goes on and your board fills with dice, your options become increasingly limited. Choose and place your dice carefully. And yes, sometimes "hate drafting" is the best move -- that is, choosing a die you don't necessarily need but that you know an opponent desperately wants. Sometimes this happens by accident, though -- don't take it personally!

Scoring is weird, with an incomplete board having no real negative. 1 point? For having a hole in my window? Seems like it should be a pretty major issue...but whatever.

I like this at least as well as Azul and maybe a smidge more. Love the puzzly, vaguely sudoko-like aspect. Like the combo of public and private goals. There's not much direct player interaction except that someone may take the exact dice you wanted on a given roll, and I like it that way.

Przepiękna, kolorowa gra, z masą kości i całkiem sporą ilości kombinowania, przewidywania ruchów i przygotowywania się na każdą sytuację. Losowość zmniejszają karty specjalnych narzędzi. Brakuje mi tylko większej liczby kart zadań głównych i prywatnych.

Excellent jeu de placement. Un peu de réflexion mais sans pour autant nécessiter de se ruiner le cerveau. Le jeu est beau et agréable. Léger bémol au niveau de la qualité des cartes.

Absolutely stunning presentation, for an elegant, simple-yet-satisfying game. My only complaint *was* that the box is easily double the size it should be, but that actually changed upon getting the first expansion, which fills up the rest of the box so much it doesn't waste an inch.

I've come up with a variant that replaces Tool cards with Apprentice cards you draw from the top of the deck and activate immediately when placing dice in certain places on the Window Pattern.

Truly a one-of-a-kind game. Involving lots of dice and forming together a stained glass portrait out of drafted dice. At first glance the game is very much confusing as there is a lot to keep track of (such as goals and tools, on top of your own board). Over time you get used to it, however at the start, one action could cost you later on. So, as long as it's explained and supported throughout the game, It can be beginner friendly. Just some have more difficulty grasping the ropes, than others.

;

Played in 2022

;

Complicated to some. 6 players with expansion.

;

A quirky, nice looking, unique game where you roll dice and place them on your board based on how they rolled. Make patterns to get points and win. It's competitive, but it can be pretty casual - I've never felt stressed playing it, which is good.

I find this best at 3.

;

Beautiful abstract with draft and great replayability.

;

Nice puzzle-y dice drafting game with a good variety of player mats and tools to overcome some of the luck elements. The variety of private objectives could be improved but some of the expansions fix that.

P.S. Is it normal to want to eat these dice? They look like little candies!

Great puzzly, colorful goodness that's easy to table and with enough player interaction on the drafting to keep you concerned about what the other players might take from you. The different tool cards keep things interesting and the game doesnt overstay its welcome!
Only complaint is that occasional errors are made by the players that are discovered way later in the game. Not a deal breaker but can sometimes be a bit of a let down knowing the game was played incorrectly. Still a ton of fun

Would have been a 9.5 except for two BIG downfalls. 1: The main attraction - the dice - are cheap!!! (yes 3 "!" marks) 2. VERY LIMITED pattern/bonus cards in the base set. This limits replay. Yes, it will change based on dice (cheap) draft and maybe a new bonus card. Did I mention how cheap the dice are... one of the red dice actually had TWO "3's" on it from a manufacturing error (no 2 on it).

I'm rarely the one to suggest it but I do always enjoy it. A good brain buster that looks really pretty and doesn't last too long. Works great as either an appetizer or a cooldown game.

;

Gorgeous production and a really attractive table presence game although a bit lonely. People compare it a lot with Azul and I understand why so I'll be basing some of my comments comparing them.

Pros
- The boards, cards, dies, personal dice pool, dice tray (5-6 player expansion) are gorgeous and it definitely attracts curious people to the table
- It has a lot of replay value as you have a lot of stained glass cards, public objectives and personal objectives. Each play feels different and one strategy will not work out every time
- The 'sudoku style' rules (no repeating numbers/colors next to each other) makes you really think about your next move and plan your strategy
- We have the 5-6 player expansion and it not only does that but it brings new mechanics and more objectives to refresh it
- The tool cards, complexity and favor tokens you get because of it adds really nice options to your strategy when you're out of luck with the dice

Cons
- More dense than Azul with more dead moments when it is another player's turn and they're thinking what to do
- Depend a bit on the dice luck although there are seldom times when you actually can't do anything at all. The private dice pool fix a bit this if it worries you that much
- No immediate feedback at the end of each round makes you completely unaware if you're doing well or not compared to others. It is really hard to peek at another player's board and calculate how much points they're doing (Azul does this way better)
- More of a solitaire-multiplayer feeling than Azul and little to no interaction with other players. You could well be playing in different rooms and get together at the end to compare scores. It's hard to really do a movement based only in how much another player needs a specific die and making it work for you at the same time.

It is different and interesting enough to have both Azul and Sagrada in your collection.

Fun, easy to learn game. Quick family game (about 30 minutes). Beautiful components. I enjoy the dice drawing aspect. Highly recommend. On par with Azul in my opinion.

;

Really pretty components, but this isn’t too far off being an entirely non-game.

The first 75% of a game is meaningless. Take whatever dice work for you and shove em in your board. It’s only when the game is almost over that decisions have any impact, and you can only mitigate outcomes 2 or 3 times throughout an entire game.

You could take a handful of dice, roll them, and stick them wherever you want, leaving only 3 or 4 gaps, and the gameplay would be almost the same to finish it off, and you’ll have saved nearly an hour in the process.

It’s simple to play, but a good chunk of a game is almost entirely pointless. The depth of a puddle.

-I simply cannot make up my mind about this game... i'm super tempted to trade it away again! It might be just too darn luck based for my nerves.
-Ok so it's back in my collection. Just gotta avoid getting hooked on solo again & teach it right to the right folks. Also, i realized the answer to placing, & especially moving, dice in tight spots: chopsticks! Gonna keep a few pairs in the box along with a couple of those kid's chopstick cheater thingies for fat-fingered folks without chopstick skills. The only other way to move dice in completely pre-surrounded spots with average adult male fingers without turning other dice is to temporarily remove a die above or below, then angle fingers SUPER carefully.
-Aside from that it's a pretty good game IF you warn folks to expect an extremely constricted & luck-based last few turns during which they must be prepared to immediately eliminate unplayable dice from consideration in order to choose from the best of the remaining (usually bad) options quickly. Otherwise endgame can easily devolve into whining & AP (analysis paralysis). Endgame luck is occasionally ever so slightly mitigateable, but only in advance through careful planning. The 1.93 "weight" rating must be for those who just react turn by turn. If you plan way ahead early with some statistical probability analysis there's kind of a lot to chew on here. For me the main trick to actually enjoying this game is to, every turn, immediately start eliminating bad choices until i've shrunk my decision space to a manageable size.
This makes me surprised that the target demographic isn't narrower. Those obsessed with optimizing turns might be chronically frustrated by how thoroughly luck can stymie their most flexible plans, but it's too heavy for folks who don't like having to burn their brains to play competently. That leaves folks (like me) who don't mind failing miserably pretty often despite pretty flawless optimal play... it gives less precise thinkers the chance for an occasional win despite pretty crunchy circumstances!
Oh & i almost forgot... a variety of very different common goals from game to game keeps things interesting.
-Ever since covid struck i've kicked myself for not keeping Sagrada. It's a great solo game if u don't mind getting hooked on something that regularly makes you yell at it!

I like it mostly because it is pretty. Gameplay could be better.

;

If this isn't in my top 25 games, it's very close! I love this every time we play and at one point requested it so often C had to say "anything but Sagrada" when we were picking. (Oops.) Everyone I've played with also enjoys it and it's really not too complicated to teach.

If you like/love the base game, the 5 & 6 player expansion is worth getting, but not necessary. It adds replayability and a personal dice pool variant (reducing some of the randomness) and blends in well with the original game. The other expansions add some interesting things, but I really don't feel the need to play with them.

KEEP FOR NOW

Nice and easy to learn dice game. Played this with the family. Even my wife likes it.

;

Attractive looking puzzle game. Fun to play, and playtime is perfect for this type of game (30-40 minutes). The personal objectives feel a little to luck swingy, but (as I understand it) there is a geek variant that cuts the value in half. Also, the expansion offers a different set of personal objectives that most likely addresses this issue.

This is a really good filler for 3-4 players, and also a nice hubby-wife game to play over morning coffee.

5+ plays, 3-4p:
I think I like this game: it's very pretty and it's fun to draft the dice to fit private/public goals, and aim for a perfect window. My biggest knock against the game is the lack of interaction. The game will end and someone will have the most points, but there's no leader during the game to rally against, and it's rarely worth your time to hinder someone. Azul is similar and offers spite drafting.

Ultimately I have to accept this game is just a pretty and pleasant solitaire. Someone will win, and maybe I'll care, but it's mostly a challenge for myself to do well. At this point, I pick the most difficult windows and see how it goes.

;

Fun to play. Game play is a little slower than other dice drafting or tile laying games that are similar, so it feels a little less exciting. But super easy to play for a beginner still trying to figure out rules and strategy. And very easy to teach.

;

Good filler game, for gamers, and non-gamers! An puzzle/dice game, with nice visuals

This should be a game right up my alley. Pretty, tactile, puzzle-y. I guess the theme doesn't really carry through in a meaningful way so it becomes a sudoku like game. I taught it to friends and the non matching number and colors next to each other became a puzzle that they didn't enjoy. Color was a tad hindrance to my color-blind husband.

;

An amazing game for two people (didn't play in larger groups). Doesn't take long to learn, but is deep enough - you need to think while playing, and every game is a bit different. This makes it really good.

Lovely straightforward strategy game, not too heavy but great, great fun and very addictive. Just my speed. And a Christmas gift from Mom! Thanks, Mom!

;

A lovely dice drafting game that works as an intro game and also as a quick filler to get through during board game nights.

Can be quite fun and thinky, with some gorgeous visuals thanks to the Sagrada theme. The idea is that you're drafting the dice you've rolled onto the 'Windows' in your Sagrada to score points by fulfilling objectives.

One downside possibly is that the dice can be somethings hard to play for those with bigger hands or who're clumsy.

Between this and Roll Player - which has similar mechanics ; I'd give the win to Roll Player for the extra elements it adds.

The 5-6 Player expansion adds the 'Private Dice' variant which I feel makes the game move faster and adds a tiny element of planning to the game which I prefer.

Game has gone down very well with family and newer gamers. Easy to teach, particularly if you leave out the special powers. What also helps are the pretty components and the low player interaction.

That said, game still has a bit of crunch to it. And you can still curse your opponent for taking 'your' die!

One criticism is that blue and green kinda look alike, especially in lower light settings.

;

I love Sagrada. I'll say it again. I love Sagrada. It's pretty, it's dice, it's placement, shall I go on? The only negative is that it can take a bit of patience when playing with certain people who can't make decisions.

I like a higher player count because it brings out more dice but it definitely plays quicker at 2 players.

12/2022- Update: Despite its beauty and enchanting theme, I had to make room on the shelf for new games and Sagrada had to go. I never liked the solo mode (it was too hard to defeat the A.I.) and my parents never chose to play this over other games of a similar weight, such as Azul. Traded away (regretfully).

6/2022- Update: This is not a great solo game, but it is great as a multiplayer puzzle experience. And it still ranks up there as one of the most beautiful games I own.

Okay, but the luck kills me every time.

A beautiful game that at first glance seems like a cute family puzzle, but in reality it turns out to be a thermonuclear five-dimensional sudoku. I played the basic version and the version with a rose (I like the version with a rose more, because it allows you to plan some of the moves until the end of the game). It is not always possible to fill out the card by the end of the game. Master's Tools, which allow you to steal cubes from your opponents, add an extra level of competition and can lead to fierce battles. In general, the game is more complex and deeper than it seems. I recommend it to fans of puzzles with randomness.

Fun low key dice game, good aesthetics, short games and minor strategy elements

;

This is a pretty game, it's super easy to set up and explain to players. There is little to do between turns which can make it a nice game to play and be social during, but this can also contribute to it feeling slow. There's little inter-player consideration when it comes to strategy so can lack that feeling of tactical moves that a game such as Azul can offer.

;

Random but enjoyable with good decisions and strategy

;

Neither my wife or I find it as enjoyable as Azul (which I think is a fair enough comparison that I see often), but we enjoy it enough to play a few times per year at least.

;

My wife likes it. Personally I think it is an above average filler if you like puzzles. It does lack any meaningful interaction, but play time is reasonable.

;

My dad makes stained glass windows, so I thought the theme was really neat and personal. I got this game as a gift for my birthday. We've had a lot of fun playing this game. It's one of those games that is enjoyable and quite peaceful.

;

Lighthearted game but challenging due to color/number combinations and limited ability to control outcomes, so I really enjoy this game overall.

A game to keep at the cottage.

Dice drafting, grid development with secret objectives. It’s like Azul only instead of end of round scoring there is end game scoring. I find azul more competitive and fun because you are more aware of the needs of your opponents.

;

Sagrada is excellent. Beautiful art, design, and concept - especially the multicolored jewel-toned dice! The game is simple to teach and attractive to all sorts of players (although it is a shade - hah - trickier for newbies to pick up than you would think, probably because of the many placement restrictions).

Nice variation from game to game thanks to the tools which always change. Fairly short, which adds to its outsider appeal as well.

All around, a special game. It's exactly what any board game should aspire to be.

The very definition of a 'gateway game,' I've really enjoyed our time with Sagrada so far, but I also wish I liked the theme more. It's pretty -- everyone comments on how pretty this game is! -- but I also wish the components (notably the dice and favor tokens) were higher quality.

It's a bit crazy how varied the gameplay feels given its simplicity. You roll dice and take turns drafting them to create the prettiest faux stained glass windows while shooting for public and private goals that boost your score. The same game can fluctuate between chill, nailbitingly tense, and cutthroat all within a few minutes.

Sagrada is one of those titles where I'd argue that expansion content is necessary -- at minimum, the 5-6 Player Expansion (sic for worst-named expansion given all it adds). At the same time, all four of this game's expansions are modular and vary greatly in quality. Consequently, shifting through expansion content to pick the modules that don't bloat the experience to heck and back is...frustrating.

Yet another in the long line of building-with-dice games; most notable for a concerted effort by the designers to teach us about stained glass, which is kinda applaudable. Despite the pretty looks, there isn't really much here to recommend Sagrada over Blueprints, which is probably still the best of the genre. Decent as a 2P puzzle: somewhat tedious with 4P.

Nice and simple game. Easy to understand rules. Good for beginners and people that don't usually play board games.

;

Gorgeous game, but very easy to mess up if you're not paying attention. Really twisted my brain in all sorts of ways trying to maximize the points I'd get. The dice are really pretty and the final product is strangely beautiful. It's kind of hard to get to the table due to its theme, but once it does, it's very fun watching everyone's brain hurt from how much thinking they have to do. Also, the app is really good, though it costs $10, which is extremely pricy for a phone app

Love the color and game design patterns. I enjoyed the dice game and color combination.

Someone on the photo comments shared the designer's advice on using 5 tool cards, but I only used 2 tool cards at solo play this time.

I was defeated by the round track target score at 56 to 46. I will try to use 4-5 tools next solo play. I got 20 for row shade variety and 12 for (3*4) color variety. And 14 for private color objective. I'm enjoying the dice game and color patterns regardless the bitter lose.

;

Colorful. Dynamic. Fast-paced, yet with significant decision-making. "Sagrada" is a unique input-luck experience where we must manage our luck through dice, using tools and our wits.

Simple, quick playing, pattern making. The handicapping system allows players of different abilities to play together. Delightful experience.

Light, fast, easy to teach and it looks great. It would be good to have some more cards with additional ways to score points. It's abstract and it involves rolling dice, but it's so aesthetically pleasant that even occasional players and players who don't like dice/abstract games will have a good time.

Genial juego de puzzles, esteticamente precioso.

What a fantastic dice placement game. It is a lovely puzzle to solve. Player interaction is minimal and mostly prevalent in the draft if other players take your desired die.

Each round, players draft dice from a central pool (two per round), using a snake draft. Once dice are drafted, players place them in their "window" following specific placement rules all while trying to achieve public and personal goals to score points. After ten rounds, each players 4x5 window should be populated with 20 dice (providing placement rules could be met), and the person with the most victory points wins.

There are opportunities to break rules based on some of the "tools" in the game, but this will be limited based on individual"window" difficulty.

This game has a nice, but difficult, solo variant as well.

The app is great fun as well , and is colourblind friendly. I also purchased some additional transparent dice with sparkles for red (to distinguish it from green) and blue (to distinguish it from purple) for use in the physical game to make it more colourblind friendly as well.

;

I am more of a board gamer and was hesitant to try a dice game. I really enjoyed this game and would call it more of a puzzle game than a dice game.

Firstly, the game is visually stunning. The colors and design of the dice and the player boards are simply beautiful, and it adds a level of enjoyment to the game that is hard to beat. But beyond the aesthetics, the gameplay is also incredibly engaging.

The puzzle mechanic of the game is relatively easy to understand, which makes it accessible to players of all levels. You are essentially placing dice on your board, trying to match the color and number requirements for each slot, while also trying to create specific patterns to score points. It's just enough of a challenge to get your brain working hard, but not so much that it creates a headache.

However, there were times when I found myself frustrated because I didn't have a play, but looking back, I realized that I should have kept some of my skill tokens to help overcome these obstacles. This is a lesson I learned the hard way, but it adds an element of strategy to the game that I really enjoyed.

Overall, I would highly recommend Sagrada to anyone looking for a fun and engaging puzzle game. The beautiful design and accessible gameplay make it a great choice for game nights with friends or family, and the added challenge of managing your skill tokens keeps the game interesting and engaging even after multiple playthroughs.

;

My first solo game (other than solitaire)! I bought it because it's pretty and I find it medatitive. It actually looks like the Sagrada cathedral windows I enjoy rolling and placing the dice. I don't like the 'tool' cards as some of them just don't make sense (or aren't particularly helpful!) It's really satisfying when you get a good roll

10th Play Thoughts   7   (Sept 2020):

I think I was jumping the gun a little bit when I said this was better than Azul. With more plays of both, Azul is a much better game, both are still great though.
5th Play Thoughts   7   (June 2020):

Really fun puzzle game that would appeal to people who like Sodoku or puzzles in general. This gets compared to Azul a lot, but I think I prefer this game.

;

Juego precioso, dicen que es la alternativa para el azul, pero no, el juego es único en su clase y genera muy buena experiencia de juego, si te metes de lleno en dar la mejor jugada, si, será AP y demora en la gestión de dados. Además, los cambios de objetivos generales y de herramientas siempre aseguran partidas variadas, además de que, son DADOS, siempre será diferente.

;

This is a great puzzle game, especially on the app. Easy to learn, and while there is quite a bit of luck, there is also a decent amount of strategy as well, planning out where you should place the dice of each color to maximize points.

It's a lot of fun to go for a really high score, not settling for anything but the ideal dice for each spot, because even though that strategy usually blows up in your face, its satisfying when the dice work perfectly in your favor.

I love this game! However, whenever I play it with friends they seem to struggle with the mechanics and planning involved more than me, and it impacts their experience and ability to have fun with the game.

Pretty brain burner. It sat aside for a few years (I think we sort of gravitated to Azul) but it really is its own thing, and the little number/colour puzzle is actually really satisfying. And it's a bit quicker than Azul, so you can get a couple of games in in the same time.

While the gameplay itself is enjoyable and engaging, the scoring mechanism is my biggest complaint about Sagrada. The final scoring heavily relies on luck and the randomness of the dice drawn. As players, we may put in a lot of effort to carefully plan and strategize throughout the game, only to be hampered by unfavorable dice rolls. This element of luck can sometimes lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction, as it seems to diminish the impact of skillful play.

;

I like this game. Would definitely recommend.

Played 5 times. Box and all pieces still in great condition.

With as heavily as Dice are featured, not really a traditional "Dice Game." More of a Puzzle Game with dynamic pieces, the dice. Good for quiet, contemplative, mature groups - or that's what this game turns Game Night into. Still very fun.

Sudoku with colorful dice. Not a particularly deep decision making space but some of the more difficult templates provide a decent, puzzling challenge. Components are nice, but I sense there is a bit of unevenness with public and private objectives. Player count is a significant factor, 2 seems less luck-driven than higher player counts. Solo is fun and a nice filler.

Got everything (5-6 player expansion) plus the Passion, Life, and Glory expansions to fit in the core box with the Broken Token insert.

The dice in this game look so cute and even edible. The drafting is simple enough, and you only ever need to make about 20 small decisions during the whole game, so it's an easy game to recommend.

This is a really good entry/gateway game for folks who haven't played board games beyond "the classics". Or if you just want a simple game that is relaxing and pretty. You build a stained glass window with dice that you draft from a community pool, and have to follow some basic rules for placing them.
I initially thought that Sagrada and Azul looked super similar, and Sagrada is prettier, so I went with it. Later I found Azul for a super cheap price ($9!) and bought several copies as gifts. After playing it, they are quite different, despite both involving drafting and placing square objects (dice/tiles) into a square grid. I think Sagrada is a lot less mean than Azul. I don't usually pay as much attention to other players' boards in Sagrada as I do in Azul. This is a more relaxing and less confrontational game. Kind of a multiplayer solitaire feel to it. Though you can and will definitely take the dice someone else wants and they will do the same to you. You really just take the dice that help you the most here, whereas there is a lot more taking the tiles you can use that will hurt the other player the most in Azul.

Асиметричність:
Не зважаючи на те, що у кожного гравця є унікальні карти особистих цілей та різні карти вітражів, гра дуже симетрична і дотримується балансу між гравцями навіть, якщо у гравців будуть різні вітражі за складністю.
Тривалість партії:
Тривалість гри може підвищуватися в залежності від того, наскільки багато часу гравці витрачають на обдумування своїх ходів. Тут зустрічаються як ті, що швидко приймають рішення, так і ті, хто дуже прагнуть виграти з усіма зусиллями, аніж отримати задоволення від самої гри.
Казуальність:
Сама механіка дуже проста, однак гра потребує певні навички з логіки та зосередження. Тому це питання не лише індивідуального характеру, а й певних вимог. Отже, нажаль, ні всі зможуть оцінити гру…але не ті люди, яким подобаються настільні ігри взагалі.
Для кого?
Для будь-якого віку від 6и років. На перший погляд, це гра представник німецької школи, проте тут наявні карти інструменти, які дозволяють взаємодіяти з гравцями на пряму. Але, в більшості, це гра сподобається шанувальникам німецької та євро шкіл. Також, особливий елемент гри – це яскраві різнокольорові кубики. Однак, може сильно відштовхнути тих, кому не подобаються НІ з рандомом через ігрові кубики.

Sagrada is probably one of the best board games out there that uses dice without suffering from the fatal flaw of excessive randomness that kills the enjoyment of most other dice-based games. While there's still a touch more randomness in Sagrada compared to other top board games (we're talking about dice after all), it's not debilitating. Each turn offers a broad array of decisions that almost never leave you feeling helpless even when the dice aren't in your favor.

I love it as a gateway game. It's easy to teach, but presents an interesting puzzle. It's for sure on the "multiplayer-solitaire" end of the interactivity spectrum, which is to say there isn't much, but that can be a good thing. This is the only board game, to date, that my mother enjoys playing with me - she likes jigsaw puzzles, but hates direct competition.

;

I wanted to love this game. It is beautiful and I enjoy a good puzzle/strategy game. My issue was that are so busy trying to lay the dice in the right location on your board and plan your next move that it feels like a solo game. Great when you want a solo game, not so when you have people over for a game night.

Very good and pretty dice drafting game. Really looking forward to some future expansions as I think there is a lot of potential for even more enhanced gameplay.

Wonderful game. Beautiful art and game play.

;

+ Plenty of replayability, lots of decisions to make, the tools nicely change it up, very thematic, easy to teach great quality of components.
+ The solo rules sound interesting and look like they'd be fun, but I've never tried them.

- I don't think gaining an extra favor token for each difficulty increase is strong enough.
- The private objective card can massively sway the scoring of the game.

Especially challenging in solo mode

I am delighted. It was great idea to combine the game theme with such well looking - colorful dices which really looks like small pieces of glass. The most beautiful game I own. Mechanic is also clever, this game is not very demanding but gameplay is average, we can play casually and just put dices to our stained glass without much thinking or put a lot of effort and try to predict every movement. Once again, great game.

Aesthetic color and components, super quick set up and tear down, elegant flow, and replayability through different point systems, tools, and difficulty. This game has gotten far more plays than I'd expect. I really enjoy the solo game as well; though easy to win, it provides a good element of decision making (using low dice to get a low AI score vs using that dice to score more than the AI with risk). Since I prefer games with more theme and story, this is a very high rating from me. I don't see it losing score over time either. Fantastic game.

A little luck-based for my tastes, but if you understand the probabilities and the things you need to do to score, it's got some good points. I prefer to play it solo.

;

Beautiful, calming game. Love playing with the wife. Usually more of a challenge to beat your personal high score rather then who you are playing against at the time

;

I only played the much maligned solo mode and didn’t enjoy it though it was a decent way to learn the game mechanics. If I play it again it will only be in a 2-4 player game.

Great puzzle with dice. Beautiful components. Pretty quick to play too. A favorite of my girlfriend makes this a great choice.

;

I wanted to like this game: gorgeous, thinky, drafty, dicey. However, for me the experience is boring and overthinky. These may sound like polar opposites, but somehow the game manages exactly that. Overthinky comes down to having so complex interactions on your own board that it's unpleasant to even try to interact with other players. A special mention goes to the terrible design and iconography on the tool cards. Not sure if this mediocre game will stay in my collection.

Hits the sweet spot for our group in some key ways: tactical, not too directly competitive, attractive components, nice gameplay. 4-player game can unfortunately drag as you wait for your turn.

Beautiful strategy with just enough interaction through the dice drafting to make every player involved throughout, without being mean. The changing tools and scoring possibilities makes it very replayable. I can't get enough of the translucent rainbow dice! A big favorite here. (LR23)

The aesthetics of this game are amazing.

It’s so evocative of the actual church, which we had the pleasure of visiting a few years ago. I doubt there’s any other game that so perfectly and so beautifully encapsulates a specific place. The game boards are stunning. The concept is devilishly clever.

Though they’re actually very different I always compare this to Azul. I find this a tad less engaging in play because it’s more complex and less interactive. I’m not sure it’s even fair to compare them as they’re very different games but I just do.

Azul is more straightforward but to me but the best part is it is directly competitive. This is a bit more complex, quite a bit more with the expansion but it’s also just a bit less actual fun to me. It feels more like a puzzle than a competition and I just prefer competitive cutthroat games.

It’s great on the app, in fact in some ways that’s the perfect way to consume this game. I’ve grown in my appreciation with many plays. It’s a forever keeper, it’s just not quite the simple perfection of Azul. But then few games are.

not quite as puzzly (or good) as Azul but more entertaining/fun. Demands a lot of thinking but still light enough and a great theme for all.

Got Azul and Sagrada at the same time. Both are similar games. Ultimately, I think preference comes down to how much random variation you prefer in your games. Sagrada has a bit more random variability in that you randomly pick the color of the dice (similar to Azul), but then also have to roll the dice for random numbers. And then Sagrada also has randomized starting templates to fill out, random private & public goals, and the random "tool" cards.

For me personally, I'll give a slight edge to Sagrada, since I like a bit more variability - it helps with replayability. You are a bit more at the mercy of the dice and random-ness, but I'm ok with it.

I also like how it isn't too hard to play this with my 6-year-old son. With him, we play without the "tool" cards - they aren't that important anyways. (The "tool" cards are the only thing that requires any reading.) And since scoring is at the end (as opposed to every round in Azul), we can just help him with that at the end of the game. (He is also now playing Azul with us, with help from us.)

One issue is that it is easy for a dice to get bumped, and it can be hard to remember what it was supposed to be. And one dice being bumped can be fairly significant. (Even dice placed in the player board thingy can get messed up easily, nut just rolled dice waiting to be picked.) In one game, it may have been a 7 point difference, which would have altered the winner of the game.

This plays like a Puzzle, thus always interesting. I suspect this is why it's so highly rated. Wife really likes this game. Thus, rated a 7. Personally, I think it only has very minor strategy elements, and because lots of Dice Rolling (and colors) are in-play, Luck is big factor, especially very early game, and end-game scenarios.

Dropped 1/2 point, because after several more plays, seems luck more & more a factor.

Added 1/2 point, because family sure likes this one. (Women like the colors, I think)

Dropping 1/2 point, because I always try to steer away from this game, though others like.

;

Easy to learn, plays quick and overall great thinky puzzle with the option to extend/modify it with modular expansions. Complements but does not replace Azul. Azul doesn't replace this either. Both are their own unique puzzles, both worth having if you like abstract puzzles.

;

Great replay value. LOVE all the dice. Yes, there's always a bit of luck with dice rolling, but this is actually heavy strategy as far as how you implement the dice.

;

One of the first games in my collection. Was very difficult to learn before I got more into the hobby and became more familiar with the idea of drafting, etc.
quick easy play. Nice puzzling.

I have not seen many comments by the designers or the publishers concerning colour blindness and better examples of the public objective cards!

Azul but with dice and a set number of rounds. I like that your player board can change from game to game. I don't like that you can just get screwed over on whatever color or numbers you need.

Fun. It’s a yet-another-set-collection game. However, I really like this one. With all the dice, it gives me That’s Pretty Clever vibes, but since the scoring method is different they fee like totally different games even though the mechanic is almost the same (in TPC you get scored on five different reigns and you get multiples of your smallest one).

I’m liking Sagrada due to the replayability it has. Your board is different each time you play. Patterns you get scoring on is different each time. Also you have additionally a private scoring as well. In TPC, it’s about figuring out best line possible in the game then tactically try to figure out how to reach it with the random dice you’re given and the super moves you’re given to try and even your luck (in TPC, you’re allowed limited re-rolls and limited extra dice usage).

Hey, I’m not saying that Sagrada is objectively better than TPC. All I’m saying is that Sagrada has some randomness in the setup, and more components that interact with each other.

I see TPC being more appealing to people who like classics such as Sequence and Rummy. I dunno hut there are some people who like to practice over and over and find peace in that. For me, if I solve it, then I’m no longer interested in it. I will still play TPC, specially with people who never played it. However, for me, Sagrada has replaced TPC as the quick thinky dice game.

——-

The variable scoring cards are just so sweet!

The variable everything setup, from the public objectives and private objectives, to the personal boards, to the tools!

Dice is just awesome.

However, some of the tools, especially the ones that allow you to move the dice that you already placed in your board, my wife and I never use them. Do you?

;

Juego muy bonito, que te hace pensar y casi para todo el mundo. Lo sacamos a menudo y no defrauda.

;

Love this game, the look, the feel, the variations. Easy to teach to new players that can do great right away. Awesome!

For some reason I now actually miss the dice box they gave with the kickstarter but I did not know the game when it was on kickstarter so its hard to kick myself too hard (yet I do...)

Update '23: Feel less urge to play it. Down to an 8.

Forgot to log plays. Might be missing something but choices seem obvious and game play is not much fun. 3 games in and not sure I’d rush to play again. Pretty though.

2nd playthrough, with family, and it didn't really capture anyone. We tried with the 5-6 player expansion and the personal dice cards rules. Rules and placement constraints took too long to explain to everyone. Lowering rating.

Same as Azul. But I think slightly better as I love me some dice.

;

Sagrada es como un escalón más de complejidad del Azul. En Sagrada jugamos con dados, pero hay que tener en cuenta tanto el color como los números de los dados. Queda precioso en mesa.

;

Sagrada has a lovely theme, high-quality components, and relaxing, clever gameplay. The puzzling is nice and cerebral, and the combinations of private/public objectives and layout cards add layers to the placement process. Very little player-to-player interaction during puzzling though, at all player counts, so this is a pretty silent game, which is still great when the mood strikes!

;

A favorite abstract.

;

Highly popular game amongst my family and friends. It's challenging enough for both gamers and non-gamers alike.

;

There's nothing like the challenge to finish a pretty window. For 2 players this is a perfect game. Fast, challenging, fun. Be aware that this has a cartain amount of luck that may break your plans on the last turn. But the better players know how to mitigate that with the help of tools and better planning. My wife does that better than me. Maybe that's why I love it.

This is a good one. Needs more player interaction - but amazing puzzle-type game.

;

Excellent

Simple, elegant, and clever game of opportunity management, requiring perhaps a bit too much thought, in the spirit of Azul but more than a bit, maybe too, luck dependent. And it is very, very easy to make a mistake (as well as cheating).

More critically, the game is dominated by the hidden special scoring cards held by the players. Those scores should be reduced by 1/2, at a minimum, to suppress the wild disparity that cannot be overcome by reasonable luck and play. UPDATE: Math of scoring card values and the average value of a die indicates that 1/3 is the correct adjustment.

THIS RAISES RATING TO AN 8.

Note: Luck can be mitigated by each player paying only 1 glass stone for the first use of each of the tools, paying 2 thereafter. UPDATE: Just always use 1 stone.

Much better than the expansion rules which slow the game too much due to 'perfect planning' AP.

;

a fun simple game based a lot on luck, but strategy definitely comes into play at times. A good one to play with those "simple game" friends and family.

I knew I'd enjoy this game! Great family game. So colourful. Simple to grasp the gameplay, but puzzle like between the objectives and tool cards. I enjoy the balance between randomness and strategy. You have to adjust as you go. Fun to play!

;

A colorful dice-drafting game that quite casual. Trying to figure out how to build your own window is quite engaging. Personally, I think this lacks a level of control, as sometimes you find yourself unable to get the dice color you need if you get too unlucky. I also wish this game had a bit more counterplay, but that's just me. In addition, finding players who want to play is something I have trouble doing. This game is too light for my friends who play board games but too heavy for my friends who don't play board games.

Sagrada

Sagrada remains a simple, intuitive and beautiful dice-drafting game, easy to teach and something both gamers and non-gamers would enjoy. The game does have some moderate problems, most notably that the clear plastic dice aren't very color-blind friendly (in particular, telling green from blue is difficult in some lighting). Also, the various tools feel a tad wonky. Still a modern classic though, and great for killing time while latecomers are arriving.

12/22: Actually ended up playing it a lot more in 2022 & came to really appreciate it. It's terrible at large player counts, but I love it at 2 players and at that count, I do prefer it to Azul for my braindead days. Raising rating. 6/18: Lovely game, but I unfortunately encountered it after playing both Roll Player and Azul. Sagrada has elements of both and doesn't really have enough individuality for me to own it while owning those two. Dice drafting & arrangement is done better in Roll Player, which is a deeper & more interesting game, although considerably heavier than Sagrada. It's also more thematic and the idea of powers is taken far further, to great effect. On the other hand, for a light abstract that requires you to draft and score for patterns.. Azul is the better choice because the rules are far more intuitive (Sagrada's rules, while few, are notoriously unintuitive and easy to misplay). Azul is streamlined, aesthetically appealing, deep, but easy to teach. Ironically, Azul and Roll Player are very different from each other... but somehow, by falling between those two, the pleasant and colorful Sagrada just ends up falling short for me.

I like this game. I always say it's a very chill game to play. It's just not very exciting and so it's never my first choice when I find time for a game.

Sometimes you just want to chuck some dice and use them in a sudoku-style puzzle. Fun and pretty game with a bit of a brain burn toward the end. The beginning feels easy, until you realize that you boxed a section so that you need a single color/number combo on a die or that you accidentally ruined a row/column you were making for a scoring condition. Easy to learn and easy to play. Mostly solitaire-like feel with drafting element (only player interaction is through the draft). Tools allow for some dice manipulation and variety.

;

Good puzzly dice game to play with more casual gamers.

Chelle: 9

This is a game that can be a real challenge. It doesn't have that many rules, but it imposes just enough restrictions that completely filling your window with dice can be a challenge. I like the dice drafting mechanism, and how it puts you in those difficult decisions where you have to choose what you need most from the available options. As with any game that uses small dice, I do wish there was a version of this game with full-size dice, because these are often hard for people with fat fingers to maneuver into spots in the middle of their board. Otherwise, this game is a true delight. I love the variety in the window patterns and the different goals in the game. But more than anything, I'm always impressed with how fast it plays. This is a nice brisk hour or less, and always makes for a satisfying play every time.

;

One of my favorite dice games, feels like a pretty pure puzzle game. Roll dice and add them to your grid, you can't put the same number or color adjacent to each other. Offers ways to mitigate at the cost of some end game points which makes the choices tough at times.

Intermediate, 4, Strategy, Take dice to build a pattern for optimal points

This is one of those games that has really simple rules and is generally considered a light game... until you play it and have to make decisions. Then your brain catches on fire. And it looks really nice, too. But it is very abstract, and if you're not into that, it won't push your buttons.

;

Mechanically, it's a good game. It's a brainburner and puzzler with dice placement, the graphics are lovely...but I can't play it too often because it IS a brain-burner. I tend to gravitate more to the more story-themed games. Hubby likes it, though, hence all the expansions XD

Przyjemna, trochę przypomina sudoku. Na myślenie strategiczne. Ładne kosteczki, woreczek i białe cosie.

I'd play it if someone requests it. It's okay, just not great. Ho hum

Pretty fun little 2 player game that isn't too heavy or long, and has some mild strategy. Similar to Azul in weight and complexity.

;

This game is super fun at 3/4 players. There is a good amount of strategy trying to figure out what dice are critical to your window and what you think the other players will need. This game can introduce AP with players though, so be careful!

Nice game but secret objectives too predictable.

;

Not a huge fan despite really liking these types of spatial puzzles. I don't like how restrictive it is with placement. I prefer to be given a set of goals to meet and be allowed to accomplish those goals using any space I want. I feel like Sagrada forces me to make bad plays because of the luck of the roll combined with the available placements. For example, I have to play either a red or a 3 (independent of end goals), but only one dice rolled meets either requirement, forcing me to take that dice even if that screws up something else. I know this type of thing happens with all these types of games, but there is something different about the way Sagrada does it I just don't like.

I'm also not a fan of the dice which I find ugly. I like the boards ok, and think the theming works great, but there is just something cheap looking to me about the transparent dice. Like children's fake costume jewelry. They are supposed to represent beautiful glass, but they just come off looking like cheap knock offs instead.

;

An excellent game. Completing the windows is incredibly satisfying. The game can feel a little lengthy (for this type of game) if you increase to higher player counts but I've enjoyed playing with 2 and 6 players.

Sagrada is a joy to play. There is no direct interaction with the other players so it is a friendly competition. Each turn you pick 2 dice from the rolled set in a draft style and place them on your board. You have to match the colors or numbers that are on your board. There is strategy involved as you cannot have the same color or number next to each other.

;

Complete your stained glass window with dice drafting. A laid back, beautiful game. Low-interaction with optional solo mode. Has worked well as a relaxing family game.

;

While this pulls comparisons to Azul, they are very different games. This is a brilliant and awesome drafting game that I am always willing to sit down and have a go at. The tactile nature of laying down the dice and the beautiful and colourful creation at the end are great. Excellent game!

;

Do not play without the dice drafting rules from 5-6.

Willing to sell this off as a bundle with everything.

Like a few other games, just has a hard time justifying itself now.

I like these types of games. I will definitely be getting the 5-6 player expansion as I find this game to be good as a party game.

Simple yet treacherous.

;

This is becoming a go-to game just simply because of its ease of play and absolutely stunning components.

Plays so effortlessly and thinky but not exasperating.

The only downside is the dice are a wee bit small for my sausage fingers and the score track is like an LSD hippies dream making it hard to score and probably the worst score track ever!

Those two are minor gripes though and can be lived with when everything else about this game hits the sweet spots

This one surprised me. Individually, the mechanisms don't sound that interesting, but they work very nicely together to create just the right amount of luck, strategy, tactics and tactility. It's simple, quick and pretty. Takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules and about 20 minutes to play a game once you know what you're doing.

Quick, easy to learn strategy game for families. Similar mechanisms to Cartographers (common aims) and Azul (tile management). Thanks Patiszon for sharing.

Colorido y desafiante, es un juego de estrategia que me atrapó desde el inicio. Para mí es un must have it/debes tenerlo en la ludoteca. Lo que si es cierto es que si se juega muy seguido puede llegar a sentirse algo monótono, ya que no tiene demasiada variedad en las tarjetas de colocación y retos.

;

There are pretty dices, boards of windows and tokens in it. Lots of people can learn it easily but the first time you always stop yourself.

I increased my rating after I realized I had misunderstood the solo rules. With the correct rules, it is an enjoyable, brain-burning, fast little puzzle. Similar to Sudoku, but prettier and with more than one solution. It is super fast and easy to set up for solo but VERY difficult to win! I'll pull it out and play when in the right mood.

I like playing this on the app, it's a decent enough game and the app works well.

Visually stunning and mechanically pleasant

A beautiful, puzzle-y, gateway game that I have not seen anyone dislike.

Edit: Still shiny and beautiful, component wise, but the dice drafting has fallen a bit, and other puzzle games are taking Sagrada's spot. Still solid, still like to play, just a little less shiny.

What new-to-you games have you played lately? We’ve recently tried Sagrada, an abstract game in which players draft dice in order to fill up their stained glass windows boards, in an attempt to maximize the number of points provided by public and private objectives.

Each game of Sagrada has players tuck in the middle of the board a card with a certain pattern that affects the dice that they can add to their boards. Some spaces have to be occupied by dice of certain colors of values, and no 2 dice of the same color and value can ever be orthogonally adjacent. Plus, you have to place all your dice in a way that ensures that they are adjacent (either diagonally or orthogonally) to already-placed dice. Besides that, each player has at their disposal some skill tokens, that they can use in order to activate tools (which usually break some established rules or allow you to change the value of the dice that you place).

Besides the restrictions entailed by these cards, what dice you draft is also going to be influenced by the objectives used in that game. They get scored multiple times, depending on the degree to which you fulfill them. Some are very straightforward – having sets of dice valued 1 and 2 for instance. Others require more forward-planning: having dice of different values on a row or of different colors on a column.

The arc of the game is quite interesting – it starts very relaxing, but by the middle of the game you have to think very carefully about what dice you draft and where you place them, as you can get stuck. You’ll want to add as many dice as you can to your board, as empty spaces are worth negative points at the end of the game.

There’s plenty of variety provided by the pattern cards and the public objectives, but where the game could have use much more variety is with the private objectives. They all function in the same way: add up the value of dice of a certain color, and the sum represents the points that you get for that card. Although this was probably meant to reduce randomness and ensure that players have similar conditions to fulfill, our preference is usually for more varied scorings.

I heard this game described as "building a stained glass window while simultaneously doing a Sudoku," which I think pretty well sums it up. I like it.

-Vitraux/Balboa Bay Window

A game that is very accessible and plays well from 2 to 4 players. Has 2 of my favorite mechanics in dice rolling and drafting combined. You work to complete your stained glass window while attempting to meet global and personal scoring objectives. Randomized tools to help you get the best score. This is an instant classic. Highly recommend for couples and small friend groups.

;

A fun and light game with simple rules and good accessibility. Looking forward to grabbing some of the expansions.

The biggest disadvantage of this game is that even completing your own stained glass window, regardless of the complexity, only offers a fixed number of points. So all this stained glass window is not really the goal of the game in my opinion. The goal of this game is to get as many additional points as possible for your own and public goals.

For me, this is a game similar to the Azul series, but a little simpler. And less exciting.

Errata: Unlike a Polish publisher, I can afford to write errata for my review.

Well, Sagrada turned out to be a unique game. I have never changed my rating of any game to BGG before. This time I have to admit my mistake because this game is worse than I thought. Sloppy translated instructions, errors in target cards, no errata, too many misinterpretations in the cards, inconsistency between publisher and author. And growing frustration.

I do not recommend.

I find Sagrada ok. A lot of people don't enjoy it as much as Azul, but I enjoy rolling dice and fitting them in to the puzzle.

6.9 - I find it a fun game on occasion, especially with non-gamers. It's light and plays fast.

;

This is another Dice Game that feels like a lighter form of Roll Player. I probably prefer Roll Player to Sagrada but this is a bit quicker and quite enjoyable.

The aim is to draft dice of varying colours and values in order to fill in their stained-glass window and abide by certain placement rules.

I like it a lot and will play anytime.

So much more game with the released expansions. Was one of the first games that got my wife into the hobby. Can be a real brain burner and I can totally understand why it could be a slog for people prone to AP. But for us this is a staple game to play with or without any expansion material, which is very easy to put in or take out.

Edit Sept 2021: Played a 4 player game and it really changes the feel from a 2 player game, but again AP could make this drag at higher player counts.

This dice drafting game quickly became a family favorite. Very easy to learn and pretty quick to play. Plus it has very nice table presence. Awesome game.

;

Brian and I got together for a 2 player game-a-thon on 2/26 and got 2 new games to me played. First up is Sagrada, the very well known dice placement game.

I liked this quite a bit, but I have a few little issues with it. I really enjoyed the components. The windows are lovely to look at and the cards that slide into them are genius. The dice are small, but well made. The card quality is OK, but they aren't handled all that much, so no big deal there.

My issues with the game have to do with the window cards themselves and the bonus cards. You can get a window that requires 6 of a certain color but not get that color as your hidden bonus card. I know other colors can go in the window, but it still seemed kind of wonky to me. My other issue was with the tool cards. They seemed to be overpowered for one player but underpowered for the other player. Example: we had the card that lets you place a die not adjacent to another die. Brian was having terrible issues connecting his dice early so he used this card and really ran away with the game. I didn't need the card early but by the time I could have used it, the game was decided.

So, pretty good. I am looking forward to playing it with more players and with the expansions I got as well (6 player and the Passion expansion). Rating will adjust accordingly.

Fun, puzzly dice drafting game. Very broad appeal, have played with a lot of family members who have loved it. For me, it's just a bit too much stress and not enough interaction so I prefer Azul for a quicker game in the same vein, but interested to see where the expansions take this one.

2019-05: Excellent puzzle game. Feels like multiplayer sudoku. I also really enjoy how the difficulty level of the puzzle you select to do determines how many times you may use special powers.

;

Played once, need to play more. I enjoyed it, but felt like others around the table weren't having fun; I think it because we transitioned from Azul to Sagrada and the latter feels a little more varied and solitary.

;

Very solid family game. Played a bunch in the last few days and while I enjoy it, I can sense my excitement fading a bit. Perhaps that's what the expansions are for.

I'll play whenever my wife wants to, since it's her fav. The game is very colorblind unfriendly, as I'm constantly asking for help to distinguish the blue and purple dice. Overall it's an easy enough puzzle, and I expect it to get a bit samey after a few plays.

Glory due out 2022 - perhaps? Danger of there being too many modules that the game isn't worth setting up? Great beginner game but good depth to strategies for more experienced. Scoring track could be better.

;

It'd be a little higher if the hidden scoring mechanism didn't feel quite so luck based; and the two player game didn't depends heavily on the dice coming out roughly equally.

It'd be a little lower if my partner didn't adore this game and always want to play a beat me at it (which they do, a lot).

This is one of my favorite shorter games. Colored dice are drafted and used to create a stained glass window using a pattern and rules for placing the colors and numbers. "Tool cards" can be used at expense of end-game points to break some rules on occasion. Rules are easy to learn but the game is thinky due to the placement requirements. This is a great gateway games to teach those new to gaming. Plus, the window displays created with the dice are very pretty to look at. Highly recommended.

Sagrada can be an easy game to teach and is commonly used as a "gateway" game. Don't be fooled - there is plenty of strategy there. The game is great on its own, but my favorite thing about the game is the expansions. I have the three expansions that are out so far and LOVE that they are all modules.

I really enjoyed this one, it's like a soduko with dice. About 15 minutes per person.

The public goals can really make or break you. In our first game, all three goals dealt with column/row goals so in order to make the most points, we were really hamstrung in a good way.

For strategy, try to fill in your locked squares first (color or pips) and leave your white ones until the end if possible. Better to have a spot you can place just about anything than a spot that can only be a purple 5.

I played with, and like, the following variants:
- remove 4 dice of each color when playing with 3 so all the dice in the bag get used and everyones secret color comes up the same number of times. With 2 players remove 8 dice of each color
- when selecting a die you can choose to discard it to the Round Tracker if you want, helps to add a little bit of strategy if you know which color others are going for.

There's something tactile and satisfying about Sagrada that is really.... satisfying!

The sort of game that you can teach anyone and is the perfect "holiday house" evening game a glass of wine. Something about the colourful dice draws people in, including those that usually have no interest in "board games". If you get the lighting right it really does look quite amazing.

A worthwhile addition to any collection and an essential buy for any half-serious collector.

Sagrada gets a lot out of relatively simple rules. The dice drafting and placement rules keeps decision making varied and interesting on each turn. I also like the inherient balancing of allowing people who choose more difficult patterns the ability to use tools more frequently/score some extra VP at the end of the game.

After playing the game a few times, you'll begin to notice that many of the tools are a little too situational to become really useful, but overall I can't imagine saying no if someone wanted to play.

Nice puzzle game. It is quick to learn and to explain and the setup is very fast, something that I greatly adore. The different board with asymmetric difficulty is something I very much enjoy, also the different public objective and tools make every game just a little different every time.

;

After 2 plays, Sagrada has become a hit. This is a dice drafting and placement game. The dice are numerous and great quality as are the dice bag and token pouch (tokens are solid glass droplets and are very nice).
The cards are good quality and we sleeved them. There is a scoring board for the end of the game.
Objective both private and public are key to winning the game.
The game plays very quick (15 minutes or so, possibly more for more strategic thinkers who take more time to plan).
We like the choices, speed, and of course the tools, which allow you to take social actions by using your tokens. The tools are randomly chosen as are Objective cards.
Finally, the dice are placed on a grid of constrained positions with placement rules. You are allowed to select from 4 different ones at the beginning of the game. This also allows doe a random starting place, but affords you the opportunity to make you strategic plans!

Solid game. Particularly good for playing with casual & younger gamers.

Lovely and beautiful game of dice drafting and board building? Need to pick up some of the expansions but has been fun with the base game.

;

Stunning artwork and the transparent coloured dice really bring the stained glass theme to life. A lovely puzzle to complete your stain glass window while respecting the board and placement restrictions. A combination of personal and public goals add to the scoring possibilities and numerous tools are available to help you find your way out of a corner.

Always a joy to play but I also love this solo! The solo mechanic is simple and brutal! Makes the wins even sweeter IMO.

What's better than reaching into a bag and pulling things out? Another game I enjoy, though I usually opt for more social games as this almost feels like playing sudoku with other people.

Easy rules but have to think carefully to place the dice.

;

A 'thinky' game that my family and friends enjoy. I like the coloured dice and option to make the game harder if required.
I would recommend.

;

This game is just a lot of fun to keep coming back to play. The expansions also keep the game feeling fresh and invite you to come up with new and different strategies. Using dice as pieces of the "stained glass window" you are crafting is a clever device that helps simulate the idea of really wielding stained glass windows. On the other hand, though, there is a lot about the game, like the dice rolling and the "crafting" cards, that don't really simulate stained glass window creation in any kind of believable way.

There are a whole ton of pattern cards for this game, including expansions made that can be picked up pretty easily on Ebay last I saw and probably a bunch of other sites as well. The spatial elements of this game can be difficult for players who don't excel at spatial planning, but elements of the expansions for Sagrada help mitigate this difficulty.

Overall, a pleasant game.

;

When starting to build my collection, this was the first recommendation for me because I'm a sucker for beautiful visuals and puzzles. I love sudoku, for example.

The components do not disappoint but I will say that I wish I loved this more than I do. It's not bad at all but I don't often have the opportunity to play this with an opponent (these kind of puzzle games are not really my SO's preference). So I often play this solo, which is still fun but I always lose by a lot. Am I missing something?

Additionally, when I do play with my SO, he never uses the Tool Cards. When I end up using them, he tends to win in the end from his unused tokens. This has sort of demotivated me from even using them... so now neither of us us them and they're obsolete.

Overall though, I really love concept and game mechanic. It's exactly what I was hoping for, I just hope the solo mode was more "encouraging", that's all

;

I like that this game is pretty chill and pretty but the tough decisions only start around round 7-8.

;

A really enjoyable puzzle. I play with the house rule to halve the score you receive for your secret colour bonus.

;

Just got this and played half dozen games right away. Only had to look at the rules book once after we learned how to play; and it was to check for the end game scoring. This is great for kids or when friends that don't normally play board games are visiting.

挺不错的游戏，比较适合推新，和《花砖物语》类似是个高颜值的抽象游戏。整场游戏体验有点类似于数独，一开始要根据自己的玩家板和公共任务来规划各个格子的填充难易度，又因为每回合都要掷骰子，随机应变也很重要。都是精算玩家的话互相可以玩得很卡。有时间打算再体验一下圣家堂的solo模式，看起来有点挑战性。

;

Personal rating: 4/5

;

From player boards, manipulation tools, public goals, private goals, and the dice themselves, Sagrada will always offer a very different puzzle every time you play. It's just the right weight to be game-y enough for bigger board gamers but accessible enough for newcomers or more casual players. While luck is a minor component, there's so much strategy here.

compared to azul, this one had less tension, less direct interaction, was less mean and overall, an okay game.

;

A easy and fast game to play. It is enjoyable, but it is also not very deep. If I am tired, it is a good game to play.

7.6 to 7

;

I just don't find it all that exciting, there's a lack of player interaction. I also find the game is not that great to look at and very frustrating to work with as a colour blind player.

;

Great game but the solo mode instructions are not well tested.

;

Juego que requiere de mucha estrategia en cada jugada. Solo hay que tomar un dado y colocarlo en tu tablero pero hay muchas cosas que considerar, muchas restricciones que obedecer. Los vitrales se ven muy bien con los dados de colores. Las partidas se pueden alargar mucho si hay integrantes que piensen demasiado su jugada.

Un juego genial. Accesible para toda la familia.

Mucho mejor que Azul, con el que se le compara tanto.

A soothing, sophisticated, sudoku-like puzzle that is as mesmerizing to play as it is to gaze at. I have never liked nor played much solitaire, but even if I had, the solo variant of Sagrada would have undoubtedly replaced it. Given its enjoyment at all player-counts, it's filler-length, and it's chill nature this bedazzling gem gets plenty of playtime under our roof.

Excellent time killer. Some of the ability tiles are a little obtuse, but the core game is dead simple. Perhaps one of the best dice drafting games. In terms of ease of play, this is absolutely stellar. The only thing I'm not too keen on is the number of promos that exist outside of packaged content, and that's somehow one of the things preventing me from just buying the physical game.

El juego es muy bonito, trae muchos dados y muchar cartas para ser rejugado y no siempre sea igual. A mí se me ha hecho muy simple la mecánica de juego y lo encuentro bastante sencillo, almenos un nivel intermedio. Creo que es muy caro por lo que es, evidentemente pagas el arte y dados, pero valoro mucho la mecánica de juego y se me queda corto

;

Dice drafting game, very easy to explain and quick to play (20-30min 2player, 60min 4player) Had a lot of fun, and there seems to be plenty of replayability. Roll Player Lite, in a good way. Not infinite consequences to each die placement and very streamlined. And pretty. So pretty.

Components are excellent, as well. Very happy with this as an impulse buy, looking forward to playing with family as well as gaming groups.

After playing 20 times, the game is still very accessible and goes over well with non-gamers, but also has a good reception from gamers. Great weight/depth for a short game, I'm always left wanting to play another round.

This can be very thinky and a rough puzzle with 4 players, aa your options are very limited at the end of the game and you are more impacted by luck of the draw, but still an awesome game!

I can see others enjoying Roll Player more, due to more options and potential for clever plays whereas Sagrada is mostly about luck of the dice and skimming your opponents' boards to see what they might not need, but I felt that Roll Player's extra mechanics were just extra stuff that distracted from a good dice game. I don't need engine building or combo scoring or pasted on themes to enjoy rolling dice and having fun.

Awesome dice game.

Solo play is in base game is very difficult. Try Solo Automata.
Never tried 2+ players.

;

The board is beautiful and the strategies completely change depending on the goal cards. In general, I love games where you have to fit things into place.

;

The aesthetics are pretty, and the gameplay rewarding (especially for neat freaks). Interactivity is limited but present (e.g., taking a die that's essential for your opponent for yourself, or picking a tool early so it's more expensive for the opponent).
All in all, a nice game when you have 30 min.

Sagrada es una especie de Sudoku con dados de colores.

Lo primero es que el juego visualmente es muy chulo, con dados llamativos, los vitrales muy efectistas y todo bastante agradable.

Lo segundo es que el juego tiene bastante miga e ir optimizando tus puntuaciones a pesar de que siempre tiene un componente de azar también es muy estratégico.

Lo bueno o malo es que al final tiene muy poca interacción, y la única forma de "interaccionar" con los rivales es que le puedas quitar un dado que le sirva.

Es divertido, incluso el modo solitario es bastante retante aunque demasiado azaroso.

Muy buen juego y muy familiar

I liek this game but we dont play it as much as Azul or some of the other family weight games, due too issues with colorblindness with some of my friends and son.

Quick fun logical puzzle game (plays under an hour). Seemingly lightweight, but underneath some serious thinking needed

;

Such a beautiful and fun game. I love it when a new mechanic comes out (dice drafting) and someone puts it into a game that's a perfect combination.

Arguably, some people are going to compare this to Azul - or vice versa, and I feel there is no comparison. This is the better "game". Azul may "look" better - in that the tiles are very pretty on the table. But this offers me a more rewarding experience. It's just enough of a challenge that it gets my puzzle-liking brain going. but it's also simple enough that I can play it casually, with little risk of not having a good time.

I can't wait to see what the expansion brings.

This game is quick, fun, and great looking. Themed around the famous "Sagrada Familia", players each have their own stained glass window to build. They do this by drafting translucent colored die and placing them next to die on their boards. There are a couple rules to this though; two of the same value can't touch, and two of the same color can't touch. Each board also has certain spots designated as a certain value or color. Players have 3 common objectives that score points and 1 secret color for which they get points for all pips on die of that color in their board.

There is a lot that I like about this game, and once I have played with more than 2, if it is just as good that way my rating will likely go up even more.

First, the components are great! Each players board is nice and thick, and has a slot to put the different board cards into for variability. Also, the dice each have their own slot so there is no fear of jostling ruining your game. The dice are simple but look great and really make your board pop out at the end and look like you've truly made your very own stained glass window.

Second, the gameplay is engaging and has just enough interaction for a game that is very puzzle-y. Players do a snake draft for the die and sometimes players will take that one die you really needed, but there are tool cards players can use to help mitigate this. It really does feel like a puzzle that is interesting, without being brain-burning or AP inducing. It's almost like a game of sudoku using numbers and colors, and the different possible goals give that extra guidance to really make you try to be somewhat optimal.

Lastly, the game does just enough rules-wise and in play-length without overstaying it's welcome on either account. I really have to applaud the designer for this. It takes a solid half-hour and maybe five minutes to teach. Honestly, I can't think of another game (for me personally) that gives me a better feeling of playing a full, fleshed out game, and having it clock in at 30-40 minutes. The first couple of times I felt like I had played a solid hour game, but really it took the two of us about 25 minutes!

I'm excited to try this with more players, but for the time being it is still an excellent game.

Very good light game. I fear it's going to fall under the light game curse, where I play it too often because it's so easy to teach and I get sick of it.

;

It is hard to choose which one I prefer: Sagrada or Azul. It´s Sagrada, I´m starting to cool on Azul. Sagrada is the newest for me and still has me figuring out the best strategies. The different objectives and tools make each play more unique in comparison to Azul. Azul, however, feels more like a game where you can outsmart the other more and be more mean while drafting, which makes it more of a skill-based game for me where the better player usually wins. I think the, for me very slightly superior, look and feel of Sagrada combined with the different avenues to win and the different "rules" in each game would give this the slight edge over Azul. It would be a difference of 9 to 9.1, so both are excellent in my opinion.

Pleasing game, but not terribly unique.

We love this game. It is right up my wife's alley, and it is fun to see your window come together. It can be hard to fail in the last turn or two when the right colors don't come out, but that is a rare problem.

Typically, everyone completes most or all of their window and it comes down to hidden objectives, or a few poor choices you know you made.

(We actually like to hide all of the objectives . . . it made us focus on doing our best window as opposed to playing the dice and intentionally taking things from each other)

Me gusta Sagrada, aún que siempre lo gano y nadie quiere jugarlo conmigo jaja un rompecabezas espectacular con la dosis justa de suerte en los dados, ya que siempre te da alguna alternativa para zafar. Pero es cierto que a quien se le dan fatal los puzles puede estar perdido a mitad del juego sin posibilidad de remontar, ya que si no eres astuta en la colocación de dados no vas a poder poner dados hacia el final del juego y puede resultar frustrante.

more my style than any of the azuls

I would have greatly preferred larger dice...to the point that I might remake the game with larger dice

I think the game is really good, it's simple to learn, but has quite a lot to offer, I love dice , the game is gorgeous, and the solo options works fine and it is a good addition imo. If you like abstracts, this is a really good game.

As solo game it is very addictive. Once you finish one game, you just want to play another.

It's a fun, simple game of dice allocation. Great production, too -- beautiful player boards! Very enjoyable!

Players each start the game by choosing a board to work on (4 unique options to each player). They also get a private goal (score VP for sum of pips of dice of a specific color). 3 public goals are randomly chosen, as are 3 rule-breakers. Each round, 2n+1 dice are rolled. Players then take 2 dice (one at a time, switch-back style) and place them on their boards. Dice must be placed touching a previously placed die and following whatever rule is shown on the card (e.g., only a specific color or number), and must be different in both color and number from every orthogonal die. They can spend their chips (they got 3-5 at start, depending on which board they chose) to use the rule-breaker cards. After all dice are allocated, tally your VP from the various sources; most VP wins!

The dice are smaller than I imagined, but so beautiful and transparent. This is an excellent little puzzle of drafting and manipulating the few special abilities available to make the dice fit the best way you can. At some point, in the majority of games, you must make some kid of compromise. It is difficult to keep every scoring possibility in your head. Yet when it all fits together, the satisfaction of getting a great score and winning the day feels quite good

Played a couple of times with 2 players and solo. I don't understand why everyone is so enthousiastic about this game. It's a very simple and abstract puzzle game. Maybe too simplistic? It has a very large box for a pretty small game. I think the public objectives are kind of boring. We always play with the colors/numbers per row/collumn, we don't like the other ones. The private objective secret color is kind of fun, but in no time it is known what player wants what color and it is good for scoring many many (too many?) points. So for now it's a 6. Not sure if it stays in the collection..

This game would rate much higher if the player boards had larger gaps between the dice. It is too easy to knock dice over when moving them. Then you are trying to remember what face the dice were on that got knocked over.

Fun and pretty to look at. Gameplay is not all that complicated but scoring can be a bit tedious. Played 2 games with 4 people. It’s a medium weight, abstract sudoku-like puzzle with a shared draft pool of dice and some rule breaking cards you can activate once or twice in a game. I think Azul is a deep game, but Sagrada has more variety with the random card setup.

Kind of like Azul mixed with Sudoku

One of the few games that I really think ticks all the boxes. It takes a very abstract puzzle and turns it into a beautifully themed game. Collecting dice on your player board is super satisfying, and although there is a lot of luck involved, there is a lot of skill and you feel that you could have avoided your pitfalls if you played better. It is easy to teach and works with a wide range of board game skills

A beautiful game that works as a gateway game. Somehow the game is just missing a little zest, because it's not long, but still feels too long, beautiful, but not attention grabbing.

I have this game because I sometimes play with people who aren't really board gamers. However, I find it somewhat dull. Lots of waiting and then you don't always get what you want. I've been told that the expansions really bring this game to life, but I don't have firsthand experience there.

;

An interesting game combining the strategy of drafting with the luck of the dice. The game is beautiful to look at between the colors of the dice and the windows you are building toward, but it's also quick to play (regardless of how many players you have) and can be handicapped based on how skilled each player is. The tool system is also great, as you typically don't need them until late in the game, but wait too long, and the price goes up, potentially to something you can't afford. There is also a solo variant if you can't find others to play with!

My knock against the game is that the dice are so tiny that they have a tendency to go all over the place, and, although the game is competitive, I get the feeling it's largely just focusing on your own thing and not really interacting with other players.

;

Very fun and challenging abstract game. I like abstract games, and I like dice rolling. Sagrada combines both into an extremely fun game. This one will force you into some difficult decisions late in the game. Expansion to 6 players is highly recommended. Another keeper.

Pretty intriguing puzzle but too solitary.

much better multiplayer than original solo mode, however there is an Automa variant I need to try at some point

It’s beautiful and I want to love it, but the randomness just kills it. Last game I played, my opponent had several blue and green bonus objectives, whereas I had red and yellow bonus objectives. The last four turns of the game, not a single red or yellow dice appeared, and two of the turns had 4 greens and 4 blues respectively. I lost badly and it felt completely out of my control.

very fun light dice drafting game. Feels like sudoku, you will try to figure out 5x4 grid to create most beautiful window (read to score the most points according to current objectives and your hidden objective).
Dice placement has several restrictions (which differs based on the player board you choose) so it is a puzzle to pick the optimal dice, to choose a place to put it on and to decide whether a tool should be used for different effect.
I am not stunned by the visual beauty of the game as most other people - what I see is just colored dice on (OK, very nice) window like board. But it doesn't mean I am not excited for the game alone. It seems I really enjoy the lighter family games to be played under 30 minutes and this game is no exception and very quickly become a staple on our game table.

What I like:
- Dice drafting and placement. The placement restrictions are really easy to grasp, but are cleverly designed and it resulted in a light brain-burny style of puzzle game which is somehow thinky yet very lighthearted and friendly.
- I like the optimization of every single move, when you try to fill the most problematic places and keep so much options for future rounds as able. Also working with different public objectives adds another layer to this puzzle, really appreciate this.
- I like the theme of the game and its implementation in otherwise abstract themeless game. The visual aspect along with the theme does its job in promoting this game

What I dislike:
- Despite of existing solo variant, this game mode is very luck dependant (depends on goals and dice throws much more than multiplayer game). But this game is really not solo game, the solo option is just a welcomed addition (and I still enjoy it from time to time, its quicker than multiplayer games)
- I would like to see more public objective cards, maybe some interesting tools (hopefully these will be added in future expansion)
- This is really a small game, I don't see the point of having this big box (aside of nice functional insert). The game would fit in half sized box.
- sometimes when trying to put (or remove) a dice from the grid can accidentally flip some other dice around. As the dice are relatively small, the manipulation with them could be sometimes flimsy.

It's a nice game but I must admit, even after quite a few round, this has not really caught on. I like to play it once in a while, but with so many better games in my collection, it only gets brought to the table as variation.

;

Wife, daughters, and friends all think this is pretty good. I can't disagree. I generally like heavier games, but if they're happy, I'm happy!

Edit: This is such a peaceful, casual, puzzle of a game... It is definitely a great game if you're just hanging out with "mild" gamers who just want to sip wine, have snacks, and just talk while playing something.

Love it

;

Absolutely love playing this with the wife, despite us both playing our own board, there's definitely a competitive edge to it ensuring no placement is wasted.

;

Very fine materials. The player-boards got the shapes of church windows with a small slot in the bottom where you put in the ordercards for every game. There are tools to use in a match and public orders which each player can fullfill in this match. The eyecatchers are the coloured and glasslike dice.

;

Sagrada is great. Very fun puzzle to solve. I think the digital version is very well done too.

;

fun. reminds me of azul style but with dice rolling. If your a dice fan i highly recommend this. Its a patter matching game. It would be nice if the bonus cards could be gained more of but i think the expansion handles this. Very high quality components. the only downsize i found was the boards could have been slightly bigger as i had a little trouble fitting dice in the middle of the board when surrounded by other dice.

;

Very fun...but the aspect of the roll of the dice, gives a tactical limitation, which at times is frustrating

;

I love this game! Drafting, Dice Rolling, Puzzle Solving and Solitaire game play are all right up my alley!

;

Very easy to teach, quick setup, beautiful game, simple rules but interesting enough. The duration is perfect

;

Not for the color-blind - or those who dislike puzzles. Sagrada seems like a light dice-placement game but the restrictions on placement, which are sometimes eased by the tools, make it quite brain-burning.

;

Rating with roulette and 6 player expansion. Love this game so much.

;

Light strategy using dice as panes of glass in a stained glass window. Utilizes a set of objectives to outline win conditions, so easily replayable.

;

Making stained glass windows with dice. A very similar game to Blueprints. The big difference is that in Blueprints, for a given scoring category only the player with the best tower gets the points, leading to potentially very lopsided games. Here it's more traditional, you get points based on how good your windows is, and then compare at the end.

Fun and interesting dice puzzle game wrapped in the Stained Glass theme. There is enough here to warrant many replays.

;

Recontly got the game but played it so much! It's got veriaty and its an amazing game!

;

More of a puzzle than a game, really. I like the drafting, but in most cases, what you need relative to your opponents is arbitrary. It's pleasant and attractive, but rarely compelling to me.

Há muito que estava curioso em experimentar "Sagrada", mas depois de finalmente o jogar, ficou a sensação de que esperava que fosse ainda melhor. É de facto um jogo agradável e colorido, que faz lembrar "Azul" fundido com "Blueprints", embora seja impossível tal inspiração, pois "Azul" é exatamente do mesmo ano...

Beautiful game of colorful dice with a stained-glass theme. I love the variables in this game: the named window cards, the decks of objectives, and the deck of tools to use when you're stuck.

This game just stands out in my collection! The concept is beautiful and I love all the pieces. My favorite way to play is with 1-2 people. Have not played with more than 3 though. I’ve gotten so many of my friends hooked on this game. It’s relaxing and challenging but doesn’t feel competitive. I love that all the cards are inspired by real stained glass windows- we enjoy looking up our play cards in real life after we’ve completed them. I’ve taught this game to ages ranging from a friends’ eight year old to my 80s climbing grandma and everyone loves it by the end of their first play through. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Family likes this one. It has its charm. I don't like to delve into strategy and I know it was playtested a ton but man it feels like those secret color objects are super powerful. You have to make sure you get a lot of high numbers of your color if you want any chance to win. Not always sure it is worth the extra clear tokens to use cards for the complexity it adds to the dice placement. I usually just do that so I have a great challenge instead of trying to win.

;

Beautiful game...looks good and plays smoothly.
Not as easy as it looks.

;

Quick and simple game. Some people are head over heels in love with it, that's fine and all but I don't know why. For me, I'm glad I have it. It hits the table often enough due to its short play time of 30 mins or less and that's about it. I do not feel entirely fulfilled after a game of Sagrada though.

;

dice drafting game where you are using coloured dice to follow a pattern and build a stained glass window. The individual goals and rules about dice placement make the game difficult but really fun.

This is a beautiful game with an interesting theme. I like the puzzle aspect of trying to fit the dice into the best spots.

;

In this whole Sagrada vs Azul war, Sagrada obviously wins. Easily. (If you think differently, you are very wrong.) It's just more of a gamer's game. Azul is fine, but it definitely has a winning strategy, and once everyone figures it out, it becomes less enjoyable. Everybody's doing the same thing so everybody knows everybody's strategy. The different public objectives in Sagrada make each game different. Plus, the whole thing just comes off like a particularly beautiful game of competitive Sudoku.

My biggest problem with Sagrada, though, is the lack of GOOD scoring cards. I don't even play with the secret color cards anymore, as they can literally be the difference between winning and losing. These are where the most points are, so if you aren't getting 5s or 6s in that color, then you're going to lose. Many of the public objectives are practically useless. Like the ones which reward you for using certain numbers. Everyone is going for them, so everyone tends to score the same amount. It seems like the Façade expansions may solve some of this, but I'm not a huge fan of costly expansions when all you really need are a few new cards.

Love this game, nice abstract, visually gorgeous, and the expansions add nice noticeable added play appeal. Storage and component quality excellent (except the scoring counters; a bit tiny and hard to read. I use colored stones as a replacement for favor tokens that way players know what tools they have already purchased.. just as a tracker, but everyone loves that personal touch. CONS: tools seem a bit ambiguous or are not easy to interpret (recommend an appendix with tool cards listed and examples of actions drafters can take with each tool); NOT color-blind friendly, (recommend iconography to replace dice pips-may not be worth the cost..I dunno)> I love this game and it's easy to teach!!!

A well done dice drafting/placement game.

;

Almost theme-less solitaire dice-drafting puzzle game. But the puzzle is interesting and the dice look cool.

;

Learnability: The game isn't the hardest to learn, but it's not the easiest either. I'd say it is fairly middle of the road. The rules are easy, but it is the rules on the cards that let you fix mistakes which end up getting most first time players confused. The best way to learn is by giving players a quick run down prior and going over steps as they come up. On average, for the people I've played with anyway, it takes about fifteen minutes for someone to get comfortable with the rules the first time they play.

Complexity: The game can be as complex or as simple as you'd like it to be. Each card has a difficulty rating at the bottom and that allows you to choose how much of a challenge you want to give yourself. The harder the card, the more complex your personal game will be. Even on the easy cards there is still a sense of complexity. As you never know what dice will be rolled of what number and what color. Also, the more players that play the harder getting the dice you want becomes. Other players can totally screw someone over just by taking a certain die.

Replay Value: The game has good potential for replay value to a certain degree. The RNG of the dice being rolled, what bonus color you pull, the bonus scoring cards, and mistake fixing cards add a pretty random feeling. You should never get the same exact set up twice. It's impossible.

Final Thoughts: The design is beautiful and it's a great puzzle game. You want to get the best score against your friends so that you can win. So there is a competitive aspect to it. If you like thinking games and puzzles then you should really enjoy this. Even if you aren't a huge fan of those, the artwork and overall design of stained glass is so gorgeous that I'd say it is worth to pick up. Just to have it aesthetically for your collection.

;

Nice, chill game to bust out. I don't mind this one feeling like a multiplayer solitaire, because I purposefully play it like that. It's really just fun to see how good of a score you can get, and when I play with my girlfriend, we'll try to avoid picking up a dice someone else needs if we can get the same points by choosing something else.

;

Beautiful filler with a nice puzzle feeling. Good variety over multiple plays due to the varying win conditions.

The 'secret color' is too influential in the final score. The expansions add some more options for the final scoring.

I enjoy this game very much. Easy to play und so nice to look at.

Innovative Sudoko-like dice placement game with variable scoring objectives and rule-bender options. It has variable difficulty levels, and the game becomes more of a brain-burner as the difficulty ramps up. Fun, easy to explain and grasp by new players, but I am not sure of the staying power.

Complaints after 8th game: the end game color scoring mechanic seems un-balanced. There are just too many potential points to be gained that are randomly determined by the dice that come out of the bag. Would perhaps be better if you scored points for each die rather than the pips, or may divide by 2? Dropped down to a rating of 6.

;

Just got it as a birthday gift. First few play-throughs have been really fun! Love the look of the game-- very colorful and beautiful. Nice mix of randomization and strategy. Plays quickly. You can easily fit a couple rounds in before bedtime.

Sagrada est de ces jeux qui attirent le regard : l’idée de construire les vitraux de la Sagrada Familia à l’aide de dés qui en représenteraient les différents verres colorés sert de splendide prétexte abstrait à une splendeur éditoriale, des dés eux-mêmes aux plateaux/vitraux dans lesquels on insère les motifs et sur lesquels on dispose les verres, produisant une très jolie composition chromatique.

Un thème assez universel pour un jeu assez consensuel, au bon sens du terme, misant beaucoup sur un étonnant calibrage entre accessibilité et cérébralité. Un peu comme Azul ou Calico, Sagrada sait continuellement investir les joueurs dans chaque moment de la partie, dès la mise en place, puis imposer juste ce qu’il faut de réflexion pour que l’on se sente libre et responsable de ses choix (d’autant que la gestion des outils/faveurs permet de contourner en partie le hasard) sans risquer une analysis-paralysis qui serait contraire à sa philosophie.

Sagrada ajoute à son élégance une volonté assez forte de rejouabilité : loin de se contenter de varier les parties grâce au seul tirage des dés, il les renouvelles avec le changement continuel des motifs, outils, objectifs privés et publics. Il atteint ainsi parfaitement ses objectifs : offrir à un public familial un jeu malin, fluide, très beau et varié - et d'ailleurs reconnu comme 11ème meilleur jeu abstrait et 23ème meilleur jeu familial de tous les temps sur BGG.

I originally had concerns over the dice size (I generally prefer "normal" sized dice), but these ones were perfect for the purpose they served on the game boards.

I love the art and components. I enjoy playing this at 2, because of how quick the games are. I like the balance of luck and the ability to mitigate said luck. I do not enjoy the solo rules, although they are simple, because they just present a very stressful puzzle, in my opinion. Scoring is also weird a bit, with the personal objective being worth a lot more that the public ones, but it's alright anyway.

Excellent game, beautiful components, and enjoyable experience to perform the basic mechanic of drafting and placing a colorful die on your board. Would be a 10 for me if the dice stayed in place more firmly and it was easier to place a die without turning neighboring dice.

I suggest new players begin by playing with only one tool card and one public objective. That let’s new players focus on the core mechanic of placing a die in a strategic (and legal) place on your board.

Excellent grid placement puzzle game with drafting, I'm not sure which I like better between this and Azul but this one has a devilish solo mode so it gets more plays.

Goal Met $2 per logged play > money spent on game or 10 plays for birthday gifts

I got to play a friend's copy at our local board game meetup today and it didn't live up to the expectation that it would have. Maybe I played with the newbie restriction (3*) and my friend the owner of the game played with (5*) and that is basically a handicap for him and not me. This game plays more like a filler because the round goes rather quickly and the game ends with 10 rounds. I didn't enjoy this nor Roll Player. I guess these two dice games failed to capture my heart. I do like Coimbra a lot more though.

As for an unfair comparison, because these two games are nothing alike except they are abstract games that are pretty to look at, Azul blows this game out of the park.

PERMANENT PLACE IN MY COLLECTION.

EDIT (27.6.19):

I raised my rating from 7 to 7.5. Sagrada still isn’t my favourite abstract but my sister loves this game so much that her excitement is contagious.

- - -

EDIT (8.7.19):

I raised my rating from 7.5 to 8. This is a solid, enjoyable game. We often play several times in a row because one game doesn’t take that much time. A good game for two players.

- - -

EDIT (10.7.19):

After 35 plays, this game has become one of my favourites. I think about it a lot, and I always feel like playing. Sagrada is a really enjoyable two player game and it has a good amount of depth and a perfect play time. It’s light enough to be enjoyed on a whim, but meaty enough to be played several nights and several times in a row.

I raised my rating from 8 to 9.5. This game is a keeper.

I’m excited about the new Passion expansion that is coming out later this year.

- - -

EDIT (1.10.2019):

I have played 65 games of Sagrada since acquiring it at the end of June this year. That makes roughly one game a day, on average.

It’s an excellent puzzle to spend time together while listening to the radio in the evening. I raise my rating to full 10.

This is a game I’d purchase again if something were to happen to my copy.

My wife and kids (6 & 4 y.o.) just love this game.

Being colourblind I am unable to play this game which is a real shame. I played it on the day I received it but was totally humiliated by the similarity of colours when played indoors with no natural light. Could you not manufacture a version for people like me please (black, white, silver, gold, blue & yellow would be among good colours or even solid colours better than those supplied, but I appreciate not good for stained glass windows!

One of the best modern abstracts with lots of replayability with new windows to choose from. Plays quite well regardless of player count.

A fun puzzle with great replayability. Excellent production, but a bit fiddly - Be sure to call out the number of the dice as you pick them up as they tend to flip over as you place them.

Better with 5-6 Player expansion, which adds new objectives and a personal draft pool, resulting in a smoother turn order and general game-flow.

I actually prefer this as a Solo game, but it plays well at all player counts.

Its a good game, and involves alot of strategy and changing your strategy at any given moment to fit the dice you roll the dice. However, it is very limited, and the range of Windows, tool cards and objectives, i would like a few more windows as it can get repetitive after you play it a few times.
£30 is a little expensive for the parts, considering it is just 90 dice, 25 cards, 4 wooden playing boards, and a set of plastic tokens. This game is one i only play occasionally, as it can get boring time after time. I would reccomend getting the expansion.

This has been the number one go to game this year for a quiet gaming evening once the kiddos go to bed. It's beautiful, simple, and satisfying.

;

Though the text on the tools can be a bit overwhelming to read, the actual concepts in the game are super-easy to understand, and there's a real strategy involved in trying to maximize your objectives. The solo game is fun as well!

I like how quick this plays. Combine the quick playtime with easy to teach rules, and this can be a go-to game for those new to boardgaming.

Revisiting this: The game is beautiful and Theo likes "playing" it, so probably won't trade it any time soon. But this isn't among my favorite games to play.

Easy to teach, a bit harder to convey strategy (think Sudoku), it's nevertheless pretty and easy to attract players.

Really really fun puzzle game, better than Azul

Not the first game I would pick to play, but definitely a go to for my partner. It's a solid game, and looks gorgeous too.

I simply love Sagrada. The rules are very simple to grasp, the contents are beautifully designed and incredibly colorful, the dice are fun to roll, and there's a je-ne-sais-quoi that reminds me of a good Sudoku puzzle. All in all, for me it's a 10!

Really digging the game after just a few plays. I expect this to be one I return to A LOT.

Got this as a gift and have really enjoyed playing it. I think we've played this more than Azul because I like the options each play has vs the similar panels Azul offers.

I don't know why but I honestly think that the visual endgame result has some kind of Beauty within it.

A decent game in the same vein as Blueprints and Roll Player. A bit more of a "puzzle" that each player is working on individually. Of course I like the theme (though it's definitely an abstract at heart). Placing the dice is quick and enjoyable.

;

Great variability with each game having a unique set of tools,goals,patterns and dice drawn. Low player interaction even though you are drafting from the same dice, it is hard to see other's boards to make decisions.The game will create interesting decisions as a result of the drafting, but i really prefer drafting games to be about playing against your opponent just as much as playing for yourself

The translucent dice in this game make for some beautiful stained glass windows

The game is similar to Azul, but I think the two games are unique enough that you'd be fine having both in your collection. If we're going to compare the two though, we like this one better because of the variable scoring conditions. We also feel that having to consider both the value and colour of the dice makes each placement even more meaningful.

A dice drafting game where each player is creating their own stained glass window. Drafted dice are placed in a 4x5 grid with color and/or number restrictions to create a "stained glass window". With each placement, the constraints on future dice grow, which makes for a neat puzzle to solve. As a bonus, the colorful dice and player boards look beautiful on the table. If only the puzzle was a little meatier.

Really solid gameplay. Your early decisions really impact your ability to complete your window late in the game. We prefer to score the personal goal as 2 points per dice rather than points equal to pip value. This makes scoring less luck-driven.

I love this game. The strategy involved in this game is my kind . The dice are beautiful. Children are also able to play this well. There is only minimal interaction with others, which helps with my children as they do not like hyper-competitive games.

Only one thing. Near the end of the game, when the window is nearly full, it is hard to place dice without moving others.

This game has a lot going for it. If Azul didn’t exist this would be my favourite abstract set collection game

;

Pleasant dice-building tableau. The hard restrictions make it quite difficult to complete your board... getting extra points for the random target cards could be quite chancy (maybe you're lucky and the other players left you the "right" dice, or maybe you're not). Same for the 3 "special powers".

Some may say this is the meat & potatoes of the game, but coupled with the randomness of the dice (both picking, and rolling) makes for a sufficient game but nothing else.

For me, this is the game that I wish had Azul's popularity. Both are very attractive, pretty games with drafting, but Sagrada has much more meat on the bone. I enjoy the puzzle aspect of it, making for engaging and satisfying play, and I appreciate how well it adds variety to scoring. If you like puzzles, especially Sodoku, this is a smooth transition.

I really like to play Sagrada. I never played it with 4 players and I normally play it with a friend or alone so, I can't give an opinion on if it is better with more or less players.
In my opnion, it is a very beautiful game and it is very interesting to play. The only thing that I find negative is the difficulty in the alone version. It is realy hard to win the game when you play alone. I think the rules for the alone version needs some changing. Maybe each empty space should only count as -1 point and not -3 ... it would make it interesting without being almost impossible to win.

The rare drafting game that I enjoy playing. Also, I usually shy away from games that rely on making patterns of colors and/or numbers, but Sagrada makes it a pleasure with its theme, variety of goals and "tools" and short playing time.

;

Dice placement game inwhich each player is trying to create the best glass pane. Templates are chosen at the beginning of the game and will show what you need to do to fill your pane. Dice are chosen randomly from a sack (dependent on the number of players) and rolled. Players then pick die in player order to fill spots on there glass template. Each player receives a private objective and 3 public objectives that will give you points at the end of the game. A very light game with some depth in strategy that plays very quickly, the art and components are top notch as well.

Sagrada is a very good abstract game. However, I’m already burned out with the game. Unlike the other abstract which have more interaction.

A game that feels thinky, meditative and soothing. It also looks vibrant and stunning.

Sagrada is a light and colorful dice-drafting game with pleasant aesthetics and components! A unique concept, the player places colored dice on their individual board representing an artist crafting a masterful stained glass window. The player positions the dice to match as accurate as possible to their chosen window pattern, while also trying to incorporate other patterns in order to maximize victory points. It's reminiscent of a paint-by-numbers, except the resources (dice) are limited and shared between the players.

Very much like paint-by-numbers, Sagrada can be a very relaxing experience, which is a refreshing change of pace from other stress-inducing tabletop games. Although this game does require strategy and adaption, the gameplay is generally laid-back. The rules are straightforward. The pacing is even (the gameplay does not slog on, nor does it race by too quickly). There is light interaction between the players, as all players are drafting from the same dice pool; so, turn order and timing are extremely important. However, there are no direct confrontations (i.e. you can't block or deny other players from making a move).

The dice are front-and-center in this game! Dice are usually a mere random number generator in most games (easily replaceable with another type of randomizer), but here the dice go beyond this. They act as the main building block for completing your objective (your beautiful stained glass window), which is a creative twist on a usually overlooked component in tabletop games.

However, with any game having a significant number of random generators, Sagrada can suddenly become difficult when misfortune occurs, leading to some frustration. So, players succeed the most when they can adapt to these misfortunes.

I would recommend playing Sagrada to those seeking a short/medium-length light game that is a bit more clever than traditional party games. This is a great title for families and casual gamers. During a gaming marathon, this is also a great option to mix-in with longer, more complex titles.

Simple nice drafting and placement game that can be played with almost everyone, provided one is aware of some basic corner cases that should have been tackled more clearly in the rulebook. Great components, except from the tool cards whose design to me looks substandard. Has quite some luck, but then it's a quick puzzle game so that's ok. Not much confrontational, overall a joy to play and a looker. Plays well solo too (see my simple variant in the variants forum).

Good puzzle. Doesn't get boring like splendor. On the same level of good-ness as azul.

slight insert damage (a little crumpled in a corner; no functional impact).

Quick and easy to grasp the basics. Feels more like you are playing yourself than against others. Good gateway game. I also incorporate the 5-6 Player expansion which adds a personal dice pools quickening game play. Awful thinky, so best played with non AP prone individuals.

;

The first time we played this it was with six people. Won’t do that again I think. However, with three or four, this game finds it’s sweet spot. There will be AP for those that are prone to it.

;

Not sure I want to keep this game. It’s great looking, well made, but it feels like a solitaire type game.
Maybe because I have only played with 1 other player, not sure adding mre players would change that. May want to sell or trade.

Fun and relaxing game. Not much player interaction and limited and repetitive personal goals make the game somewhat flat.

Extremely fun and strategic dice-placement game. Easy to learn and play and has plenty of variety. Really enjoy playing this with my wife!

A very deceptive game. First rounds can make you think it's a relaxing sudoku derivative, but when there's less room for the dice in your board it really gets tense. I still consider it's a relaxing game, but I don't think is as light as it might seem at first glance

Dice-rolling abstract made beautiful and "worth it" for a guy who really digs theme above most other things. Quick and fun for the whole family.

I really enjoy Sagrada; especially at higher player counts. Not only is it a very eye-catching abstract, but the game play is super intuitive. It does play somewhat solitaire-like, but the die drafting piece does make it feel interactive. I do wish there was more variability in bonus cards.

;

Fantastic looking game and always fun to play. Often compared to Azul as a similar style family game. I think that this will appeal to anyone who likes Azul as it's essentially placing dice to create patterns with certain restrictions, same as in Azul. I personally think that Azul has a better game mechanic, with Sagrada having a more significant luck element to it, but it's great fun

Because it's pretty, easy to teach, and allows me to chuck dice in my DIY-ed dice tray (that still makes me feel so accomplished!). If I have this out, GB will more than likely be enticed into a game. I do find the solo variant extremely punishing, especially if you roll high and don't use tools. I wonder if I should house rules this when I play solo and only use one die on the round track? And always choose the highest die to place on the track?

A deceptively simple dice drafting game. It plays quickly, but there is plenty of strategy to be found between the public and private goals. The components are great, doing justice to the name.

Time will tell, but the game appears to have enough diversity between the 10 public goals and 12 tool cards to have a pretty good shelf life.

Roll Player has similar dice drafting mechanics with a bit more of an engaging theme.

This one is a really good abstract game with short enough playtime to play it more than 3 times or more consecutively. This game is even for people who normally do not play boardgames - the hole family likes it!

Sagrada is a beautiful dice-drafting game. The different scoring public and secret cards increases the replayability. The variety of windows difficulty also make the game interesting. The solo variant is very fun but brutal at the same time. The game plays quickly and there's basically no set-up time, which is a great thing when playing with my girlfriend. Luck is a HUGE factor in this game as you need to pick the right color to fill your specific window restrictions AND roll the appropriate value.

;

A surprisingly thematic game for what initially looks like an abstract puzzle game about making stained glass windows. The luck of the dice can dictate the direction of the game, especially with 2 players where you don't see all the dice.

;

I love the dice drafting and trying to make a loose plan. Have the expansions and like them all.

OOOoooOO BOY is this one a beauty. Can never really say no to chucking dice OR tableau builders and this game is a streamlined exercise in how to do both perfectly. A big retailer mainstream crossover hit, this game will satisfy your casual group, your more advanced gamer group, and even offers a great little solitaire version of the puzzle to beat if you just feel like rolling some stained glass goodness!

Fun light dice drafting game. Window strategies and selection is not obvious regardless of color (good thing?). Usually seems best to draft for yourself and hate only when there are no good selections. Can be difficult to use tools because dice cover board requirements. I have fat fingered a bunch of dice off the board before and I am scrawny. Fiddly late game checking spots.

Quick game, simple but pretty components. Enjoy the puzzle like aspect of placing your dice to meet all the requirements.

Have played this game several times over the last few months. The game sounds much easier than it is! Lots of fun, even my wife (who I wasn't sure would enjoy it, as typically she doesn't enjoy word/numbers games as much) really liked it and even suggested we keep playing. I expect it to be a winner at my house for years to come, I am looking forward to owning the expansion! Recently I've been playing with newer gamers who are drawn to the colors of this game and simple rules, then who are surprised to find how difficult the game can be. Still love this game.

Finally got to play this. It's quite enjoyable, especially the fact that scoring can vary from game to game. I still feel like Azul is the better game, maybe because you can plan your decisions better. In this one it's often just about what you want, and not what the others want (unless you play with 2 players I guess).

It's the BEST underrated SOLO board game and also fun multiplayer!

I REALLY love playing Sagrada solo. The target score is decided by the dice we don't choose. It really makes the game feels like multiplayer without using a fiddly automa! That's not including the ever changing objectives, mission card (I forgot what is the name) with various difficulty and tools. We can avoid getting bored while also adjusting the difficulty.

Another aspect I like it as a solo game is the setup time is so quick (well, it's a really dicey game), and it doesn't take up a lot of space. The rule is not complex. The playtime is set in just 10 rounds so we know it won't take too much time. We are also not required to think too much (no analysis paralysis!) and get punished right away nor think too little and get bored.

Well, the box is not portable enough to bring every day, but the solo gameplay is perfect! I also love rolling a lot of dice!

I don't really get the fever buzz this game got. It is truly beautiful, and it is a fun puzzle, but it is not much more than that. I enjoy playing it, but after I kind of feel that I was just wasting time a little bit, kind of like how I feel after putting together a 500 piece puzzle. It wasn't that hard, it didn't take a lot of energy, but it was fun and I like puzzles.

High points for being beautiful and a fun puzzle.

Brillian, easy, fast, beautiful.

This game is great! The gameplay is fun, and it just is so nice to pick up and handle the components.

ok but a little bit boring for me

One of the top games of the year that it came out of. For first timers getting the placement rules can be a little much. Snake draft can really screw you up.

We purchased this game a few weeks ago. The first time we played we were overwhelmed and thought meh at best. I am grateful for a family rule of at least 5 plays before we make a decision. This game is now one of our favorite games.

Pros:
-looks beautiful
-a fun game with tons of strategy
-has fun challenge cards that changes the game each time you play
-made for older children
-has a stopping point
-a game teens want to play

Cons:
-you need to spend a few plays before learning all the ins and outs of the game

Education:
-strategy building
-focusing

Overall:
This game is a favorite. It has a lot of strategy and looks pretty. You play on your own, and add up the points at the end. My favorite part is how this game works on rounds. You can only play 10 rounds. While some players take longer, you know there will be an ending and this is something I like.

We have played this game at least 10 times and enjoy it. It is one that is picked quite often. Once we were on our third game play, we knew this would be a keeper in our book. So happy to own it.

Solid and easy to teach puzzle with gorgeous looks. It's a bit more complex than Azul and provides more variety. I like it more. Going to stay.

A very nice way to spend some time with friends and family

Beautiful game and a fun dice drafting mechanic.

Just like life, a game of Sagrada starts out so full of hope and promise. You can accomplish all of your goals! As it goes on, your options get more and more limited, often as a consequence of your short-sighted or overly optimistic decisions. You have no one to blame but yourself for the shambles your existence has become. But unlike life, you get assigned a numerical score at the end!

I really like games that involve a lot of tough decisions. If my friends and I are sitting around a game, grimly silent except for the occasional exclaimed curses, then my girlfriend says "This just be a great game!" She knows my tastes too well.

I know some folks prefer not to play with 4 (because of the time between turns), but I find the game to be good at all player counts. Although the game can trigger AP in some people, I generally find it to be a quick game.

Short, approachable and enjoyable dice placement game.

A very nice abstract game! I especially like how the tension rises when the possibilities get fewer and fewer, it really has a dramaturgical arc. The variety of the window cards, the extra twists of the ability cards, the personal goals you can score - all that results in a good balance. The translucent dice are beautiful, feel good, the game even has an elegant and challenging solo mode. All in all a nice package and an abstract that feels surprisingly exciting.

;

Good and fast dice game. For me, initially, Sagrada lost the competition with Azul, but both are good and quick abstract games for up to four players that deserve a space in my collection.

;

Like the aesthetic and possibilities of this game. Dice draft is so enjoyable. Such a pleasant experience overall and wish to play it more.

;

Nice little dice drafting game that looks beautiful on the table. Component quality is excellent. Simple mechanisms combine with some interesting decision making to create a fun and entertaining game. Did I mention it's pretty?

Updated thoughts: Some new players might find this game frustrating. In general, it feels very restrictive. As you play, you are constantly navigating a series of restrictions as you try to place your dice in the most effective way. New players easily grasped the placement restrictions printed on the board. Likewise the orthogonally matching restrictions (same colors / same numbers cannot touch sides) make sense and seems logical. However, when these two sets of restrictions come together, it can be really frustrating to figure out how to get the dice to fit. One of our players rage quit and probably wouldn't play the game again.

Sometimes you get the right dice that you need. Other times, the process of analyzing the dice feels like a series of disappointments: If I place this there, it might make things difficult later in the game; if I place this there, I won't be able to place one next to it later; if I place this there, then I won't be able to score any points for this row; if I place this there, then there will be an empty spot at the end of the game; I can't place this one there or there, but if I had to it can go here; I can't place this anywhere, but I could use that tool to move that one and then place this one there; I can't place any of these dice anywhere and I have to skip my turn.

The placement system gives the game depth, but the result is not something I find particularly fun. It provides satisfaction more as a challenge than something that is fun. In our games, we're sat together in silence running through the many options each turn. The downtime in this game can be unsatisfying, as it takes quite a long time to make it back to your turn when your are the first player when playing a four player game. It's also to difficult to plan in advance because you can't really predict what other player will choose, so most of the time spent in between your turns is wasted. Not being able to plan much in advance makes it even more difficult for players who tend to get analysis paralysis and everyone waiting on them makes it worse.

Additionally, the components can be a source of frustration for some. I appreciate the double-layer game boards with recesses for the dice (something I wish Azul had). However, the small dice and compact arrangement on the board might be difficult to use. When the board starts to get full, it is easy to accidentally knock a die out of place. If you forget what number it was or even where it went, this can mess up the entire game. People with shaky hands or thicker fingers might have trouble especially.

Initial thoughts:

Nice components (cards feel a bit flimsy though), pretty game, nice box insert, easy to teach, visually appealing to new players / non-gamers, smooth gameplay, scales number of players well, solo mode, scoring requires a bit of calculation.

Although there are some similarities with Azul, the gameplay experience is sufficiently different to me. Sagrada has a more multi-player solitaire feel, with each player trying to do their best at their own puzzle. Azul can be quite competitive and even cut-throat at times, where you're working on your own puzzle, but also considering how the other players will act—whether to sabotage them or compel them to act in a way that benefits you by also benefiting them. The extra bit of randomness and shorter rounds in Sagrada make it more tactical, forcing players to make the best of the situation, whereas in Azul the information is a bit more stable making it possible to run through a number of strategic scenarios for the round in your head. In Azul, much of the game can be about looking at the other player's boards, and in one decisive move you could make a turn quite difficult for them. I like that the scoring in Azul happens throughout the game, and the way it goes up and down creates interesting tension, at the end of the game there's not much calculating to do and you can quickly tell who won. In Sagrada, you add up scores at the end and compare numbers, which is not quite as exciting to me.

I don't mind the multi-player solitaire aspect or added randomness of Sagrada, to me this gives the game a different feel, either game suited for a different mood or group.

I also appreciate the solo mode of Sagrada. It's a peaceful, puzzley way to spend some time.

I love the look of this game and the puzzle of creating your stain glass, but I loathe the scoring. There have been games where I have completely finished my stain glass window, but I lost to someone who had open spaces because they scored better.

This is a great game and on it's own and we enjoy it, but rarely play without the expansion. The expansion adds a spot for your own personal dice supply that you can play from. To be honest with so many abstract games out there, we prefer a couple of them over this one. So unfortunately this game doesn't hit the table as much as it used to, but it's still a keeper.

;

Fun, easy to learn, challenging to master, fast play. Pretty!

;

Fun dice-drafting puzzle until you get near the end, and random dice from the bag might not allow you to do anything on your turn, no matter how efficiently you've played up to that point.

;

This is so pretty! Pretty good also!

Perfect

;

Pattern building and dice drafting. Love this game! Always a hit when we bring it to the table. Carefully select dice to match your window’s pattern and complete special objectives. Great game under 30 minutes

;

It can be a very interesting game. It also depends (I think) in which of the 3 powers (special actions) you draw for your game. Some of them lead to more interesting games than others I think.

Absolutely beautiful game. Sagrada takes the dice drafting mechanism from Blueprints to the next level. The different scoring and dice manipulation cards introduce enough variety that will keep this game feeling fresh for years to come. It also begs for an expansion!

Colourful Sudoku in a nutshell. An incredibly unforgiving game, Sagrada is one of the best fillers our group has found in 2018, with most of us playing the game non stop. A clear favourite in the Abstract/Pattern Building genre of games, Sagrada is amazing provided one can spatially visualise how the stained window will look a few steps in advance.

Sagrada is a fairly light dice-rolling game. The game is very visually appealing. It needs more cards to add variability from game to game, but the expansions definitely help this. I am always willing to play Sagrada, especially as a filler.

A puzzle game using dice. Plays fast enough that the luck factor is not a huge problem. Lots of replay-ability with all the different cards.

Rated an 8 because family likes it a lot. In the abstract, more of a 7 for me.

;

Feels inferior to adjacent games in two different dimensions. First, original Azul is much more memorable, with both rush and huge score strategies, stronger, clearer defense, and full information. Second, Roll Player is much more thematic, and it's both easier and more fun to see what opponents are up to. In comparison to these, Sagrada is a mostly multiplayer solitaire repetitive grind.

Für die Kirche Sagrada Família wird dringend ein neues Kirchenfenster gesucht.
In jedem Zug wählen die Spieler für ihre Fenster dazu zwei farbige Glasstücke, repräsentiert durch Würfel in allen Farben des Regenbogens. Jedes dieser "Glasstücke" muss nun sofort in das Fenster eingesetzt werden. Zudem gilt es bestimmte Farb- und Schattierungsvorgaben zu beachten, die für jeden Spieler anders aussehen.
Dabei dürfen gleichartige Glasstücke niemals nebeneinander liegen. Zum Glück gibt es eine zufällige Auswahl an Werkzeugen, die es einem ermöglichen, das „Glas“ auch nachträglich noch ein wenig zu bearbeiten oder gar auszutauschen.

This game has a lot of charm, and the dice drafting is implemented very well. My only complaint is that I don't know that it has the legs for a lot of repeated plays. On the plus side, it's great for entry-level board gamers, and it is still rather fun to "build" a stained glass window!

Agree with the sentiment "multiplayer solitaire". Don't agree with the way that it's used because it's nearly always said in a negative or condescending tone. Going into it knowing that's what the game play lends itself to, I quite enjoy it and find others do as well. Fun solo option to boot.

Don't normally like dice games. The randomness just makes the whole exercise feel ... pointless. And yet Sagrada has me coming back for more. How? Drafting dice, mitigating glass beads of action, and board difficulty variability. Good on you Sagrada.

Solid 'tile-placement' game, with interesting mechanics.

We initially played the game as a genuine sudoku (no color/number doubles in any row/column), which made it terrifyingly difficult to play, but after the rule-update it has become a lot easier.

Still we like the added difficulty, so we might keep it as a houserule.

A nice suprise hit with us! This takes the "roll and write" formula (roll dice, fill out spaces while keeping other spaces open for future rolls), but actually makes it into a compelling, more strategic game. The special actions add a bit of dice manipulation, and the drafting mechanic means you're not necessarily stuck with a single roll. Plus, you don't have to use up paper to play it! With this and Roll Player released last year, I am really digging this new genre of dice game.

A light dice drafting puzzle game. Looks amazing and has a unique theme. Good for those non-interference game sessions and mild brain-burning feels.

Beautiful, puzzly, game of dice placement. Good entry level style game of dice drafting and placement (by color/numerical value). Hidden objective cards add a variant, as well as the public cards players can use to manipulate their window.

I really love this game. There is something soothing about the colors and the feel of the dice, which at the same time the strategy really makes me stretch my brain.

[Floodgate Games 2017 edition] {Church; dice-rolling, set-collection, solo; scalable} Sagrada is a very nice looking family game. It is essentially an abstract puzzle solving game, with limited choices. Player interaction is quite nice. It's fun to play.

It is easy to teach and learn the games as long as long the dice placement and function cards expense rules are explained.

This game looks easy with 4 players. Most of the players can complete a window. Maybe, there are just too many dice to be drafted. The game becomes less challenging. Nevertheless, all dices are used, the game is less luck driven.

The game is also a challenging solo game. I can barely win.

Replayabilty is limited. I don’t think this will be a keeper. Its expansion are too pricey. I will trade it later.

It's mostly multiplayer solitaire where you occasionally get screwed over by someone else's draft choice. What I mostly appreciate about this game and what separates it something like Azul for me is how puzzling and difficult it can be to place things in your window. One of the first plays I had of this game was a late night session after gaming all day and many mistakes were made - it goes to show the challenge and how careful you need to be. On top of the gameplay, it's beautiful.

One of my wife's favourite games.

Even after a couple games, my son could not stop playing with the dice and boards, filling in patterns, sorting dice, and playing with the favor markers. Such a clever, little game, and each time played, it's trying to put together a puzzle, in order to optimize the community and personal scoring, while not breaking any of the placement rules (or using the tools at the right time to do so).

Stunning game, really like how it looks with all color dice.
It is simple, yet tricky, really like that it can be played with boardgamers and family and kids. Diverse game for wide range of players.

Welcome to the MX5 review, summarizing the game after at least 5 plays. See the M5X Challenge for all games and reviews.

Sagrada

Overview Build beautifull chruch window glasses with colorfull dice.

At the beginning of the game, every player deceides for one window grid. The grid tells you essential restrictions that you need to consider when placing a die, either about the color, or the die value. All players share three common goal cards, e.g."Have a die of different value in each column". During each round, a number of die are rolled. Players select a die, place it in their grid. After 10 rounds, the player with the most victory points is the winner.

dice drafting

Beautfull, colored die. Transparent glass token. Glossy prented church window tiles. Goal and tool cards. Sturdy, beautifull game box. Superb quality.

High. Each game you choose between window grids, have different goals to achieve and tools to use.

A great opener for any boardgame event. Simple to teach and play with people who are not familiar with boardgames. Beautifull components make the table a piece of art. When you play it more often, you devise new strategies for placing die, and take more care to see what the other players need to do - in order to disturb their build.

I'd like to play it a couple more times before I decide to buy it, but it seems inevitable. It didn't hurt I won my first game

Great, fast thinky game. This seems like it’s the standard for dice drafting games that all others should now be compared against. The random draw of public scoring objectives and tools (special abilities you’ll get to use a few times during the game) makes each play feel different. You can also choose whether to use or not use the private scoring cards (which just makes you want to maximize total pips of a specific color). BGG seems to prefer it with 2 when you have the most control, but I wonder if that’s because players are spending a lot of time looking at opponents’ boards and hate drafting. I like to play it like the other players’ boards are hidden, and prefer it with 3-4. The solo game sucks - a really bad random puzzle that feels like a waste of brain cells.

As a color-blind gamer, I struggle quite a lot with the colours in the game. But the mechanics are interesting, and it all adds up to a pretty decent game.

My girlfriend loves it - so this will always be in our collection!

Build a stain-glass window in the Sagrada Palace; complete a set pattern using coloured D6

Very beautiful game, nice little puzzle that is a light filler for me, think the expansion will had more so it doesn't get too samey throughout play

;

I enjoy the depth of the game and that it is fairly easy to teach. By the second play, most people feel comfortable with it. I also like that it feels a bit less confrontational, there's a winner (and they can win by a lot) but everyone still gets to play and feel like they are playing. Not just being crushed by the veteran as they play.

Loving this game! It's beautiful and very strategic. Also, using the tool cards really helps!

the mechanics of this feel similar to doing a sudoku - not a game you can talk through - constant calculations if you're trying to win

;

Love the dice and the puzzle of placing them. It's nice that there are cards of varying difficulty for players of differing experience.

;

Much better with 4 than 2. Quick and easy to learn but a real head wrecker trying to maximise score whilst avoiding blocking yourself from certain placements.

Good family game that get's tougher every turn. Looks great.

Super quick and easy to learn. A great gateway game. The objective cards that encourage you to place the dice in specific patterns add an element of challenge and strategy. Only criticism is that there is a slight lack of player interaction - one mechanic of this game is to keep an eye on what other people are doing and try to block them by taking the dice they need. But there are so many objectives to meet, and strict rules as to where you can place your own dice, that you’re just focusing on completing your own window and it feels as though everyone is playing their own game. Still great fun though and something I’ll play if I don’t feel very competitive and want to chill.

2017-06-21 - I really like this puzzle of a dice drafting game. It's gorgeous, simple to teach, and quick and fun to play.

2017-09-22 - This game is so good. Elegant with a really interesting puzzle. I recommend removing dice based on player count (so you get the same color distribution), but otherwise, I think it's just great. Upping my rating to an 8.

2019-09-20 - Sagrada is a fantastic puzzle, and I'm still not even close to being bored with playing it. Raising my rating to 9.

;

I enjoy the mechanics of this game. Great gateway game - easy to teach/learn. I only use the private 'shade' goals from the expansion. To keep the game within an enjoyable time length (when playing with AP players), I use a 30 second timer (per player turn).

;

Visually very appealing. Quick to explain. Great gateway-esque game. Short but doesn't seem like a "filler". Good replayability.

;

Extremely straightforward rules but still chock full of interesting decisions in its short playtime. Seems like a fantastic gateway game. Very low interaction though, and with people that aren't engaged, it can drag because of it.

Update: Great as a 2 player game as well, very quick and probably at its best played this way. My score is now a 7.5 without the "5-6 player expansion" and 8.5 with it. I don't even plan to play with 5-6, but even at 2 players the private dice pool and new private objectives elevate the game a hefty amount for us.
Update 2: lowered slightly to an 8 because I just lose this game all the stinking time. I normally don't rate a game based on how well I do, but just being naturally bad at a game does affect my enjoyment. My wife, who is amazing at the game, continues to love it and would probably give it a 9.

Got at books a million north myrtle mall October 2017.
Have played this (mostly 4 player) about half a dozen times now. I really, really enjoy this game. One of the best "blind" pick ups ever for me. I had never even heard of it when I saw it on the shelf, and it ended up being the hit of vacation. It scratches that pattern building itch of games like patchwork, which my wife loves, but it has more to it to keep me interested, with the 3 random objectives each game and random dice pulls/rolls which give you new decisions each turn. It reminds me slightly of a mix between patchwork and Blueprints, but for for now this is my favorite game of the 3, easily. My wife and pretty much everyone I've played it with likes it as much as I do.

I owned Azul first and while comparisons are drawn, both are absolutely different enough and worthy of my collection. The dice are beautiful, the theme works and the personal and public goals are awesome. If I'm comparing the two, there is definitely a bit more strategy here. Sagrada is more of a brain burner but a fun one at that.

My rating for the original game with the original rules and original private objectives cannot be more than 6. The original private objectives are quite poor, as they all are of collecting dice of some certain colour to get as many points as there are pips on them. Those dice colour objectives also don't support public row colour objectives very much, as you must avoid having more than one die per colour in one row. Also, when there are 2 or 3 players, it's possible that your private colour dice are not pulled out of the bag as many times as other colours are, as there are 90 dice in the bag regardless of the player count.

For games of 3 or more players, I don't like that turn order goes by snake method. So if you are starting player, all other players take both of their turns in between your turns. That can cause too much down time and disturb the game flow.

Please note that this rating is only for the original game without any expansions.
But luckily it can be fixed. With 5 & 6 player expansion, this game is pure 10 for me!

What a colourful, beautiful game! Easy to learn, fun to play. It has a solo mode that can be really challenging and I like that. A quick game after work it's almost a routine to help us forget the stress from a day at work. Always at a reachable distance when you really want to play a fun game but you don't have enough time for a long one. Touching the dice, looking at their translucent vivid colours, and even listen to the sound of them in their bag also contributes to the experience of the game.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2018)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game due to the hype. Acquiring Sagrada was hard and expensive because it was out of stock everywhere. After playing it, I can say I enjoyed it and I want to play it again .

The rules are pretty easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. Playtime is around 1 hour with 4 players, although it probably plays better with 2 players.

The theme is irrelevant to me, but when you finish the game, the windows look gorgeous on the table. Sagrada´s components are good.

Gameplay is engaging and interesting as long as all players play quickly. I think the game can have some downtime and I really hate this part, so, I prefer it with 2 or 3 fast players. I just found out Floodgate Games plans to publish a 5-6 player expansion. I almost always dislike this, but I will buy it anyway for the rest of the components. I don´t see myself playing Sagrada with more than 4 players. In your turn you have to pick a die and use it the best way you can, this is a fun decision, but not really hard. Sagrada has a light-medium weight.

It seems the game has a high replay value because you have lots of objectives, tools and windows to try.

I´m still undecided if the luck factor is high or not, controllable or uncontrollable. You can lose if the color you need doesn’t appear, but my gut feeling tells me this won’t bother me as the game plays rather fast and you have some tools to use to help you when luck doesn’t go your way.

Bottom line, Sagrada was a pleasant surprise for us, it is more deep than I initially thought it would be. My SO liked the game so we are keeping it for now. I need more plays to see whether its rating will improve or fall. For now, I will buy all its promos and expansions and I want to play it again soon. Gorgeous game.

Very pretty puzzle and dice drafting game for 1-4 players. The many colored translucent dice and the great looking player boards give the game a nice table presence. The puzzle element where you try to create your personal pattern while completing as many public goals and score secret personal goal points and also try to mess with the opponents is rather challenging! Great fun. I find the game similar to Tiny Towns, Azul, and Reef. I prefer the two first in in mentioned order, to Sagrada, which I like more than Reef.

A good family game for grown ups. Pretty dice in different colors that is a real puzzle to place, and other players to ruin your plans. What's not to like?
I think the point system is rather broken - focus on your private mission and ignore the common goals and you will have a good chance of winning. This will take a good deal out of the fun of solving your puzzle, so mostly I just ignore the winning conditions and focus on the game instead

;

The goals varying from game to game is cool, but you can be left without options at the end if you get unlucky.

Extremely clever forward planning and perhaps a little luck will help you complete your stained glass window by the end of the game The public and private objective cards add an extra layer of strategic thinking to Sagrada. Very good game.

Pretty simple game that has some interesting depth to the strategy and choices that you have to make. Very easy to make a move that blocks future moves if you aren't paying attention. Also looks very nice on the table.

It's a good little roll & write. You don't actually write, but it's still a roll & write. Actually, it's more of a roll, draft & write. The fact that players are drafting from the dice pool results is what really sets it apart from other roll & writes and gives it an extra layer of strategy.

It's a good filler game: easy to set up and quick to play. It's light and fun, but I probably wouldn't play more than one game in a row, usually opting to play something else instead.

Love this game. It succeeds on so many levels. it is beautiful on the table, able to be played by experienced and new gamers, infinitely replayable, and the ability of players to choose cards of varying difficulty makes it uniquely suited for players of different skill levels to compete with each other on a more level playing field. Fantastic game that is a favorite with everyone we've shared it with.

This has become a favorite in our house!

May have replaced Azul for our family.

Nice concept, fast rounds. Challanging patterns so you need to think before dice placement.

Reminds me of Azul with more replayability because of the different patterns and dice rolls. A really great puzzle game and would definitely recommend!

Sagrada is such a great dice drafting game. There are some concerns over the personal goals being over powered, but honestly I haven't felt screwed over by them in any of the handful of plays I've had. I love the look of the game, it really has amazing table presence, and it goes very quick but still gives you agonizing decisions as you get claustrophobically cornered in by just playing the game! It's just a plain fun experience. Very good game.

Abstract

This is a super cool little drafting dice game. You pick dice one at a time to fill out your own stained glass windows. Each scoring track requires you to do something different so there's a little something for everybody.

Maybe better as a solo experience as it seems like your dice placement choices are not really to limited until about the last round or 2 so it is tough to try and screw someone over until near the end.
Seems like the punishment for an empty space of only 1 point is not really that steep.

;

I enjoy the puzzle. But I like role player more.

;

I've not enjoyed the games of this I've played. I always find that I'm not able to mitigate the dice rolls and colours enough. I need a red or a 6. All the die are 2s and blue. I like how the game gets tighter, but I also like games with interaction between players and the drafting wasn't quite enough. The tools are a step towards resolving my issues, but they're very powerful and thus limited. Production is lovely though!

This is a fun one! Lots of dice rolling, as you try to build your own stained glass window. My wife loves the aesthetics, said it's a pretty game. I enjoy the gameplay as you're drafting dice and trying to follow the rules of which dice can play where within your window. It takes some thinking and strategy, and is an enjoyable game.

;

I'm a big fan of dice drafting, and I love the puzzle element of how to best place your dice in the window. It's a great weight-level, light enough for non-gamers to enjoy while offering a decent amount of depth for those of us who like that. I also really enjoy the amount of variability of goals and tools, and it plays quickly - we can play a 3-game set in about an hour (2 players). Overall, this is a great game for me.

;

Really nice little puzzle game that goes quick with 2 players. Feels a little like Sudoku, with elements of Azul thrown in, which is basically the snobby gamer way of saying its a great puzzle game. Long story short, if you like rolling dice, puzzles, or any combination of the two, this one's for you.

Attractive mp solitaire with little player interaction. Like it better than Roll Player, where you have similar mechanisms, but Sagrada is more streamlined and less slow-moving. Since the success of Azul multiplayer puzzling seems to have become trendy! My group liked it better than I expected. It's a good game, but personally I think Reef and Azul more interesting.

Para jugar con gente no iniciada y que haya algo de reto

;

Beautiful looking game on the table with the colorful translucent dice. For a game that seems very solitaire-is on the surface, there's quite a bit of indirect interaction with the dice drafting and using the tools. It's exactly what I want in these abstract games since multiplayer solitaire games aren't my thing. Also I love the amount of variability with how every game scores differently and which tools will be available. Sagrada is the type of game that won't likely give me the itch to play but I'm always happy when I do.

;

Very nice, approachable dice drafting game. Absolutely needs the expansion for 5 players (an extra board with KS version does not mean the base game is playable with 5).

;

I really like this game, it's only downfall is that it is not color blind friendly which greatly reduces my opportunities to play it with others.

Like Azul, but with dice. Interesting premise, purchased on the recommendation of the Game Boy Geek, but ultimately wound up disappointed. Fun, but not amazing.

;

Excellent filler type game or good for multiple plays in a row. Simple rules with plenty of (hard) decisions to make. I enjoy the variety of scoring methods and this game seems to have a surprising amount of strategy. My only knock is that no matter how much you plan the dice can ruin your plans, there is some mitigation but, again, you only get a few of those options each game and the ones you get may not be the ones you really need.

Plays well at 2. Fun, colorful, fast but thinky. Will have to try with more when the kids are home.

Got to play with 5 on Easter Sunday. Obviously a bit more downtime between plays but still enjoyable. The little dice tray included in the 5-6 Player Expansion made it very easy to pass the dice pool around the table. We played the basic rules since most hadn't played it before.

It's pretty, and it's a good puzzle. Of course I will play!

For us as a family this solitaire dice drafting game has been fantastic, our daughter has pick it up so well and it has been greet for us. I use the word solitaire loosely. We don’t hate draft and we help each other complete our windows. Winning is nice but a side show.

;

A brain burning puzzle game that really has some great unique ideas with using dice as the glass of a cathedral. Stream line rules but has a vast amount of variety with the different tools and public projects. the hidden objectives give a nice long term strategy. Overall a surprise for me and a great game.

;

I absolutely loved this game when I first started playing it. after two months of owning it and playing it almost every game meetup, the game has started to feel pretty same-y. still, a very good game with a lot of play to it and I'd like to try other dice drafting games in the future.

;

Replay-ability: Having only recently played this game I think that it has a good replay value as there are many different window patterns in the base game and these paired with the variety of tool cards makes the game different each time. The fact that their is a random dice rolling mechanic that can change the shade of colours (different numbers) as well as different colours means that the likelihood of having similar rolls isn't that high.

Theme: This games theme revolves around creating stain glassed windows and does it deliver? Yes, yes it absolutely does! not only does it offer dice that are coloured but also explains how the number on the dice determines the shading of that colour. low numbers being lighter and high numbers darker it really makes you feel that you are creating a masterpiece. I would say that if the colour of the dice darkened depending on the number that would make it even better, but I really like the colouring of the dice as it is, giving that stained glass effect.

Difficulty: The difficulty of this game really depends on your window pattern cards as depending on the pips in the bottom right hand corner depends on how hard your game is going to be. Lower pips lower difficulty. This means that if you are playing with both adults and children you can adjust the difficulty for each player to make the game fairer. With that said Taking a difficult window pattern isn't all bad as you will get more favours to use on the tool cards. This makes the game more strategic for the harder patterns and easier to learn for the newer players taking the lower pip cards. The rulebook also has a good explaination of setup and scoring system with example.

Final Thoughts: I personally feel this is a lovely game that is fun for all level of board gamers. It teaches the essential elements needed for other drafting games and is therefore a gateway game to other drafting games such as Azul, but is still fun. I do however feel that you do not need to put too much thought into a game, which is why I have only rated it a 7, greatover a pint but doesnt quite scratch my strategic itch.

This past weekend was my first experience with Sagrada and I really enjoyed playing it. I had never played a dice drafting game and I really enjoy that mechanic and the choices that it creates as you try to accomplish the game's objectives.

I also really enjoyed the game objective cards and that each game becomes a different game because the game objectives are different each time. Do you get rewarded for having colors in a diagonal line this game or having a row that has all five of the different colors? Depends on what card objectives are present for that game. This creates a lot of fun replayability.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game. One negative I might say is that there are different windows that you can create that are more difficult than others. There is no bonus points for choosing a more difficult window other than you get more tokens to use for purchasing those tools powers. Seems like you should get more points at the end of the game for completing a more difficult window - but I have only played the game four times.

Overall a very fun experience - especially for gamer's who don't like the "take-that" type of games.

Solid Game

Enjoy playing this game, despite my colour blindness. Great replay value, even though there are limited window cards. The colourful dice are always a treat to play with. Suggest playing the game in some place where there is direct sunlight to refract off the dice - Enhances the experience!

Have played it. Perfect for boardgamers that are not that much into strategy and planning, but still want some challange.

Dice rolling and drafting game with some minor use of powers and placement.
I think I like this game's theme better than the game itself, but that's ok. It looks fantastic and is a quick, easy run.
Using transparent dice was genius, really sets the mood.

Good family game. Sometimes way too luck dependent.

Visually nice entry game. Rules are easy to learn and while not complicated all that rolling, drafting and placement of dice is quite satisfying. If you want to play some family friendly game with easy accepted theme you can try this one or Azul which we also considered.

A fun little dice drafting game. The game does not take very long to play. My wife will play this with me.

Abysmal component quality and gameplay that's only slightly more interesting than watching paint dry. Pure KS trash.

Lots of hype on this one. I had it on my wishlist and took it off. But, as it turns out, through desire and research, as well as Jen wanting to try it, added it back and got a copy. Looking forward to it.

;

When I bought this one, it was obvious it will contend with "Azul" in the "abstract filler" category. Full disclosure: "Azul" won. Does it mean "Sagrada" is a bad game? Hardly.

I do enjoy the puzzle it has to offer: trying to keep plenty of options open while fulfilling the goals (private and public). It's certainly not mindless, most of the time there are at least several viable options and you CAN play skillfully (which means: doing everything you can to avoid bottlenecks - places on your board where you need very specific dice). So why do I enjoy "Azul" more? Because it's straightforward. "Sagrada" has some moving parts that are clunky and feel superfluous. Using tools in late part of the game can create downtime, whereas "Azul" has a very natural flow once you "get" the game. All in all, "Sagrada" is simply less elegant, but still entertaining. But if you want just one of the two, "Azul" is the one to go IMO.

Dice drafting game, lots of fun working to build your window, can choose an easy or difficult game, powers and objectives vary per playthrough.

it's beautiful and just interesting enough to keep coming back to

Wow this came out of nowhere to me. I don't really pay much attention to KS games so when a friend busted this out I'd never even heard of it. This is killer filler, right here. Lots of juicy little decisions, some fun passive-aggressive denial aspects, randomization for replayability, and of course: dat playtime.

There's a noticeable luck factor during the endgame, but since you can set yourself up for greater flexibility toward the end it's not a dealbreaker for me. All around good stuff.

It's definitely best as a one-on-one. The denial aspect is really strong in a way that it just can't be with more. Still, though, I'm happy to play with any number.

;

Easy-to-teach Sudoku-on-a-board with beautiful components. Not terribly deep but a lovely gateway with a fair amount of replayability.

;

such a beautiful puzzle not much player interaction but the dice drafting component can cause some great tension and the tools give you a unique opportunity to feel powerful and like your doing the puzzle well

;

The kids seem to have much more fun than the adults with this one. Placing the dice is a little harder with adult hands I suppose. However, concept is great and fun, just hard to keep track of things since everyone is always accidentally moving their dice trying to set one in.

;

Nice little puzzle for each one to solve. The personal objective is too much of the final score, so maybe the expansion is needed to solve it. Evaluate more before buying.

;

I like dice drafting I cannot lie.

Beautiful game of dice placement. Well designed. The dice drafting adds a good feel of competition.

Review: http://twooffthetop.com/2018/10/12/sagrada-review/

;

Is Azul better? I think so. Is Azul more fun? Yes. But something about Sagrada works just as well as Azul--it's different enough in style and it has a different feel. The drafting is less combative, so it's a little more loosey goosey. This I think is more fun with multiple players, as you can just all relax and build your windows. Azul is cutthroat--and that's great too, so it really depends on your mood.

EDIT: Bumped this up to a 9.5 from an 8.5 because the solo mode was amazing and I played it four times in two days--this has seriously impressed me.

;

A beautiful game eclipsed by a somewhat simple dice-drafting mechanic. I haven't played enough hard windows to judge the actual strategy/complexity of the game...

;

The go-to game for people who want to "step up" after their first gateway gaming experience.

Great game and beautiful to play, though sadly the private objectives can introduce too much luck into the game so despite how well you play the highest scoring objectives will win it.

I enjoyed this one. More going on than I thought.

;

Great solo game.

;

Great game for what it does. Components are of stellar quality and once you play it the first time, games take between 15-25 min. It offers a lot for the little time you get to play. Dice drafting is always fun. In a two player game there could be some slight hate drafting, but it is very minimal as you always will most likely focus on your own window.
My only complain is that there could have been added a few more tool cards and window patterns. I'm sure that they will be offered in the upcoming expansion, but hate to pay more for it as it adds a 5th player and I don't see the need to play it at that count. Overall amazing filler, and a keeper.

I prefer Roll Player, but it is a fun game that is easy to pick up.

;

Dice drafting puzzle where you make a stained glass window. Pretty thoroughly OK.

;

I really did not enjoy this game. There is very little room in the rules for variation and games usually end before the 7 turns are even over.

;

Good puzzly game. There is little player interaction. I think the game plays best with two.

;

While this game can be a bit tense, over all I find it rather relaxing. It's a nice feresh/recharge game for me. It's aesthetically pleasing, easy to learn and quick to play.

;

This was a smash hit for us! Puzzling our dice out to fit the best they can, sometimes with additional powers. Looks great, plays quick.

It's nice. Relaxing. There's tension, but you never feel like you're being targeted by the draft as everybody has their own individual puzzle to work out. You get a pretty window at the end.

Very simple to learn and teach, looks pretty on the table and very approachable. Variability is there with different goals, tools, and die rolls will always be different. My wife loves it and non-gamers are attracted to it so definitely a keeper.

;

Scratches the same dice-placement itch as Roll Player but in half the time.

;

Really pretty abstract game revolving around dice drafting and placement. One of those laid back games that plays quick and should provide an easy point of entry for a wide variety of gamers. May be too much of a multi-player solitaire for some.

;

My husband and I like Sagrada a lot. It offers straightforward rules, many interesting decisions, and a beautiful presence on the table.

;

Excellent thinky Sudoku-ish style game. Easy to teach.

;

Always play with scoring/setup variants:

- Same number of dice of each color in the bag at start
- Dice of your color score points equal to half their value rounded down.

;

Exactly what I want in a family weight dice drafting game. Turns are quick, looks great on the table, interesting enough choices while still being easy enough to teach to pretty much anyone.

Unlike Azul, this game is really satisfying as you get to actually complete your board. I like the symmetrical personal goals and the variety of shared goals. The tools are really interesting too. It makes the game play very different each time, yet it still feels really balanced. Just enough luck to avoid AP, yet plenty of interesting choices from the start. Sometimes things don't go your way, but that's often due to a choice made early on that restricts your options later.

;

So beautiful! Very light, but deserves some thought.

;

Gorgeous and thinky. A little trickier than Azul and not as easy to teach.

;

This is a thinky, puzzle-game that is a lot of fun and offers various levels of difficulty. I can pull out a couple boards and play multiple puzzles by myself and still have fun, but is even funner with others. This is a great dice drafting game, I would highly recommend it! And pick up the 5/6 player expansion to get more cards, more tools, more everything.

nicely balanced game, I don't get the "pretty" comments I constantly see. I do find the game very fun, easy to bring to the table, and easy to teach. it would get a higher rating if it were able to handle more people.

;

Aesthetically a very beautiful game. A lot of thought was clearly put into the design of the components. This is a very easy game to teach, but is very strategic at the exact same time. If you have the chance, buying the 5-6 player expansion further enhances the experience both aesthetically with new components (dice box and dice rings) and also in regards to the game-play by speeding the game up by having certain dice preselected.

From my 2017 Secret Santa

Signed copy by Daryl Andrews at Dice Tower Con 2018

An interesting concept. It certainly can be intriguing to play, but it's very much dependent on how well people roll. When I tried it we had a serious problem trying to roll '5's which can lead to issues with completing the game.

;

Uno dei nostri preferiti!!! Non stufa mai!

;

Sagrada is a dice-drafting game that is great for players that are wanting to add a little complexity to their gaming experience. The rules are simple to learn, but has enough complexity that mastering the game takes a few plays. Players take turns drafting dice and placing them on their board, each with different placement restrictions. Dice cannot be placed near a die of the same color or number. Victory points are awarded for filling in your board, the amount of favor tokens remaining (based of your board's difficulty), bonus objectives and your secret color objective. A mild amount of planning is required to make sure that you don't block yourself from placing dice.

;

A nice light game that's great for a variety of types of gamers.
I own both Azul and Sagrada and they are both great in their own regard. I prefer Azul, but my wife prefers Sagrada.

Where Azul is completely open-ended and has the simple goal of everyone filling out the same boards to the best of their ability, Sagrada is much more focused and has clear, defined goals. I enjoy the open-ended problem solving in Azul, but it can be difficult for my wife. However, she loves the more specific goals you are working toward in Sagrada.

My only problem with this game is there can be a great deal of luck involved in the dice rolls. Sometimes you need one specific number and you just keep getting shafted by some bad rice rolls in tandem with an unfavorable draft order when the dice you're looking for finally shows up.

There are very few window pattern cards in the base game, so I may need to get the 5&6 player expansion soon.

Luck of the dice draw too big a factor for 2-player games. Not as much a problem at higher player counts since more dice are drawn to choose from.

Like the game and theme. Helps that my wife and I actually visited the real thing. Also like all the colourful dice. Game looks lovely and fairly easy to play. The problem is every time I have played it someone (many times me) misplaces dice in their grid and you don't discover it until late in the game!

;

Brilliant game! Short setup, easy to explain, crunchy little decisions, 2 player takes 30 minutes. It should have won SdJ. This game is great to play even with non gamers. Not as cutthroat or punishing as Azul (which is also a very good game).

My favorite game at the moment. Every die you draft has the opportunity to make or break you. Lots of planning ahead. Can’t recommend enough... plus it looks great!

;

One of the best made game I've played. Gameplay is never boring (even if you play 5th part one after another). It is sooo comfortable. Box isn't too big, every space was filled. The best thing for me was when I discovered that windows fits the bag perfectly, so you just need to slip the cards into it. I am waitind for the expansion to get some new goals and wait for another addons.

;

Nice looking dice drafting game. We enjoy building it so much. Player mat at the game end is fantastic.

;

Don't let this easy-to-teach game with its beautiful stained glass images and multi-colored dice fool you! This is a very fun puzzle that can become rather cutthroat. Lots of variety and options to handicap players of different skill levels.

;

There's something very addictive about forming patterns with the very pretty dice. Everyone who has played has wanted to play again. The only downside is that the dice are quite small and rounded so it's very easy to rotate them accidentally as you insert new ones into your grid. Not a game for clumsy or fat fingered players!

;

I admit, Sagrada was an impulse purchase. I thought it was pretty. This is what ya get when girls play boardgames LOL! Thankfully, it's a solid game with simple mechanics and thoughtful strategy. This falls into the category of puzzle games - kinda like Blokus or Patchwork. You have a limited choice of pieces (dice in this case) and you must place as many dice as you can on your own player grid, while following placement restrictions. There are favor tokens that you can spend to help you throughout the game. It consists of 10 rounds of dice-drafting, so it is fairly quick. It scales nicely as well, since you simply roll less dice for less players. I'll always play when presented with opportunity. 8/10.

;

A very solid game, very easy to learn, but gets really tight really fast. Decisions become hand-wringing, mind-wrenching conundrums. It’s a wonderful puzzle to solve.

;

One of my favorite games. It's easy to enough to teach new people quickly while offering plenty of depth for experienced players. I do love puzzles though, and at its core, that is what this game is. A very beautiful puzzle.

Fun, fast euro game.

;

I like it. It's pretty easy to make an error, though. I find that it feels a little brain-burny as a result. And not in a good way. It's not quite to Ricochet Robots-stage of headache inducing, but it still feels really tense. I think more like...say...playing Ingenious. You place something down and immediately need to check to make sure it's legal where it is.

Kathy wanted it for Christmas, so I got it for her in 2018. Also raising my rating to a 7 after a second play.

;

Sudoku with colored dice! This is a game you can play with your grandparents but still have enough tactical depth thanks to the powers and objectives. Scales well with any number of players and plays a lot differently than other games in my collection, which is always a plus.

;

Plus 5/6 player expansion

;

Beautiful game, very eye catching. Easy to explain. Probably on a similar level to Century games in terms of gateway. The type of game that makes you want to play multiple times. Great variety in windows, but wish there were more end game scoring options.

;

This game looks amazing on the table. I enjoy the game play but find myself wishing there was just a bit more to it.

;

Really good game. Have played a number of times. Game is complex with the hard patterns and require a thoughtful planner. Clever game.

This game is great. First of all, it is beautiful. Secondly, it is fun and satisfying to play. It is definitely a puzzle solving kind of game. It kind of reminds me of sudoku sometimes.
I do wish that the point totals varied a bit more. Usually it is pretty close at the end, no matter what you do. There isn't a great way to pull ahead of your competition.

Incredibly thematic and pretty, Sagrada is a game where you draft coloured die to make a stained glass window. Players are dealt a backdrop that establishes the rules of your particular window, and then dice are chosen at random from a bag and rolled to establish where they can be placed. Resources can be spent on abilities that circumvent the normal rules. Sagrada is a lot of fun, and forces you to adapt to ever changing circumstances.

;

WAOW. Better than Azul . And so beautiful . My wife 'adore' this game .

;

Fun drafting mechanic, Beautiful game with vibrant colors. A unique theme that tied into the game well and no weird or dark elements which is always a plus in my book. Light but thought provoking, something that can be played with gamer and non gamer friends. The different cards that came out per game make for lots of replay-ability with different objectives. Game is very well done at the time of writing this is in my top 10. I highly recommend. I own the 5-6 player expansion but haven't tried it yet.

;

Plays fast, plays differently every single time, has a great expansion (with more inn the works), it's beautiful to behold, it challenges the grey cells. I love it!!!

;

Beautiful production. Makes the dice roll drafting mechanic a little more interesting. Very prone to AP though, especially towards the second half of the game. Kind of ambivalent on the tools, often seem to make things more complicated, almost want to take it out when teaching to non-gamers.

;

Pros:
+ It's pretty with all those colors
+ Simple, short game

Cons:
- Needs more cards
- Could be a drag if there is a strategist that takes 10 minutes to think about his move

Juego abstracto, muy entretenido, fácil de aprender

Oh! Excited about this. Out of the games I'm waiting to receive from Kickstarter at the time of writing, I think this is the one that's the most different to anything else I have in my collection. I don't own a lot of games with dice, and definitely none that can be called dice-heavy. This has dice as the main component, but still uses them in a pretty new and innovative way. And it looks great!

EDIT: After playing a few times solo and a few times with my wife, I can already say this is exactly what I hoped for. It's light but still thinky. It requires both strategy and luck. Players of different skill can fairly play against each other by choosing appropriately difficult window cards.

I'm looking forward to playing with 3 and 4!

EDIT 2: Since my last update, this has rocketed up my most played games
My wife absolutely loves it, so I get to play games with her a lot more often since getting this game! The game is beautiful, very simple to learn, but with enough depth to stay interesting. It works very well at all player counts from two to four. I did like the solo variant, even though I found it very hard. I don't play solo very much though, so I haven't tried it any more since my last update.

I like this one for a couple of reasons: First, I really love the dice! So many of them, and so pretty. Second, it's a great gateway game. It looks attractive, it's not heavy on the rules and it plays fairly quickly. All that makes it very accessible to non or casual gamers. Finally, I like the variability in the objectives and tool cards.
