      "++ Very good light weigth dice-drafting puzzle game that is surprisingly \"thinky\" where you work with the randomness of the dice to \"solve\" your window pattern by trying to maximize your victory points from the game's objective cards using your tools (special action that can help you manipulate your dice).\n",
      "++ The theme is still pretty well implemented for a somewhat abstract game.\n",
      "++ Great replayability coming from several different window pattern cards, several different objective cards (of which only 3 are used in each game), and of course the way the dice are rolled (different color dice draw from the bag and different value value all the time). It's surprising how a different combinaison of public objectif cards and tools can change a game.\n",
      "++ Great components: The player boards are great, with recess spots for the dice and with a nice glossy finish; the dices are great looking; the dice pouch is beautiful and the glass tokens are nice. These component really give this game a nice table presence and a nice tactile feel.\n",
      "++ The solo game is really fun and challenging. It's a simple twist from the original game (not too much of rule changes) and offer a great quick and thinky solo filler game. It can take a few game to get use to it, as you control both your score and the target score to beat, but this is so much more fun than just achieving a certain score to get a ranking (anyway, your score would change a lot according to the available objectives, as some are more easily done than others).\n",

      "-- It's a tiny bit more luck-driven than I love, as at lower player count, you won't see all the dice colors equally, depending on the draw, so sometimes you are desperately waiting for a certain color that may never show up again late in a 2-player game (as we only see 50 out of the 90 dice in any game). A BGG user suggested to scale the dice according to the player count (so 10 dice of each color in a 2-player game), and I'll try that variant as it should correct this problem. EDIT: This has been implemented in the 5-6 Players Expansion.\n",
      "-- This is less true for 2-players games, which is the best player count IMO, but it's sometimes hard to closely monitor exactly what your opponents are needing exactly (so it's may feel mostly multiplayer solitaire for some as there will be less \"hate drafting\", but this doesn't bother me much).\n",
      "-- The solo mode as per the rules is too hard without any tweaks. I thus currently play with a simple but efficient HOUSE-RULE (SOLO MODE): Take Favor tokens equal to the difficulty level of the window pattern divided by 2 (rounded up). These Favor token can be spent to re-draw and re-roll all the dice you just took from the dice bag (this limit the bad draws, especially late in the game where sometimes the dice drawn cannot be place at all so you lose a lot of points while the target score increase a lot because you may be adding 3 or even 4 dice to the track).\n",
      "-- If want have this game mainly as a gateway/welcoming game (like me), which this game is awesome for, you don't really need any other expansions than maybe the 5&6 Players expansions, as using any of the The Great Facades ones really complicate the base game too much for this game to stay a great gateway/welcoming game.\n",

      "Comentario: Świetna gra, która początkowo nie wiedzieć dlaczego wydawała mi się skomplikowana Zasad jest mało, ale za to jakie rozkminy zachodzą w czasie swojego ruchu ! Która kostkę wybrać, by nie zrobić sobie problemu na planszy. Przeklinanie pod nosem, gdy jesteśmy zmuszeni skorzystać z narzędzi by móc dołożyć do planszy kostkę, która nie jest dla nas optymalna. Oj jest to czasem wredna gra, ale nie z racji negatywnej interakcji (choć tej może być ciut przy grze na 2 osoby, gdy możemy sobie podbierać kości, które mogą interesować przeciwnika), ale gdy losowość jaka występuje w tej grze daje nam osobiście popalić. Z tego względu nie jest to gra dla każdego. Fajnie, że można do niej dokupić dodatek pozwalający zagrać nawet w 6 osób, czego np. brakuje mi w Azulu, który jest chętnie porównywany do Sagrady. Niby są to podobne gry bowiem układamy jakiś wzór by zyskać jak najwięcej punktów, ale zdecydowanie w tym względzie Sagrada jest trudniejsza od zwykłego Azula. Niemniej jest tak samo ładnie i solidnie wykonana. Mamy też insert, który być może pomieści jeszcze elementy z dodatku na 5-6 osób na co liczę. Grę polecam do wykorzystania w bibliotekach i na świetlicach szkolnych. Spokojnie dzieci ok. 8 letnie jeśli są ograne mogą zagrać pomimo, że wiek pudełko to 13+.\n",

      "Comentario: Have both a physical copy and the Steam version developed by Dire Wolf Digital. Regarding the Steam version, it's a beautiful rendition and I enjoy playing it. As a solo game, Sagrada is very tough. Playing it digitally helps tremendously as you don't have to worry about the adjacency rules (i.e., same color side by side, same number side by side) because the software does that for you. Overall, a great game and I'm happy I have the digital version. Regarding the physical version, I've played both Azul and Sagrada now, and while they have similar mechanics, for me they scratch different itches, so I enjoy both.\n",

Instead of just trying to reach your own personal goals you now also race for common goals, try to reach secret, hidden goals (Ticket to Ride style) or do better at scoring certain goals than your competitors. It makes it all a bit more a social experience of playing together.\n",

Because most goals involve drafting high numbers focusing on either a single color or specific positions, the general strategy remains roughly the same. If more unique and interesting goals were added, I think it would improve the game a lot.

      "Comentario: Pretty Game, easy to get people to play, but the more I play it the more I find that, more often than not, the correct play is to just pick the highest value die you can, and that ultimately winning depends on whether your hidden color was rolled high or not. This is especially true in two player games, which I do not enjoy playing at all.\n",

Everyone pretty focused on their own board and not much player interaction apart from \"oh no, they took the dice i needed\" and that's it. Might become fun with more plays and in depth thinking of how to maximize points with the given goal cards, but not very exciting during the first couple plays, so i doubt we'll get to that point; Good visual presentation though.

The variety of different ways to score allows you to have an idea of how you and your opponents are doing, but not exactly.

      "Comentario: A dice drafting, set collection, pattern creation game with \"Public Objectives\" (bonus points for creating certain types of patterns or sets), cards that help you mitigate unfortunate dice rolls or allow you to occasionally bend the dice placement rules, and a \"secret goal\" for each player. The game is played in 10 rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a beautiful, colorful game, it's fun to toss dice, and it's absorbing. As the game goes on and your board fills with dice, your options become increasingly limited. Choose and place your dice carefully. And yes, sometimes \"hate drafting\" is the best move -- that is, choosing a die you don't necessarily need but that you know an opponent desperately wants. Sometimes this happens by accident, though -- don't take it personally!\n",

There's not much direct player interaction except that someone may take the exact dice you wanted on a given roll, and I like it that way.\n",

At first glance the game is very much confusing as there is a lot to keep track of (such as goals and tools, on top of your own board). Over time you get used to it, however at the start, one action could cost you later on. So, as long as it's explained and supported throughout the game, It can be beginner friendly.

      "Comentario: Gorgeous production and a really attractive table presence game although a bit lonely. People compare it a lot with Azul and I understand why so I'll be basing some of my comments comparing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "- The boards, cards, dies, personal dice pool, dice tray (5-6 player expansion) are gorgeous and it definitely attracts curious people to the table\n",
      "- It has a lot of replay value as you have a lot of stained glass cards, public objectives and personal objectives. Each play feels different and one strategy will not work out every time\n",
      "- The 'sudoku style' rules (no repeating numbers/colors next to each other) makes you really think about your next move and plan your strategy\n",
      "- We have the 5-6 player expansion and it not only does that but it brings new mechanics and more objectives to refresh it\n",
      "- The tool cards, complexity and favor tokens you get because of it adds really nice options to your strategy when you're out of luck with the dice\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "- More dense than Azul with more dead moments when it is another player's turn and they're thinking what to do\n",
      "- Depend a bit on the dice luck although there are seldom times when you actually can't do anything at all. The private dice pool fix a bit this if it worries you that much\n",
      "- No immediate feedback at the end of each round makes you completely unaware if you're doing well or not compared to others. It is really hard to peek at another player's board and calculate how much points they're doing (Azul does this way better)\n",
      "- More of a solitaire-multiplayer feeling than Azul and little to no interaction with other players. You could well be playing in different rooms and get together at the end to compare scores. It's hard to really do a movement based only in how much another player needs a specific die and making it work for you at the same time.\n",

      "-Ok so it's back in my collection. Just gotta avoid getting hooked on solo again & teach it right to the right folks. Also, i realized the answer to placing, & especially moving, dice in tight spots: chopsticks! Gonna keep a few pairs in the box along with a couple of those kid's chopstick cheater thingies for fat-fingered folks without chopstick skills. The only other way to move dice in completely pre-surrounded spots with average adult male fingers without turning other dice is to temporarily remove a die above or below, then angle fingers SUPER carefully.\n",
      "-Aside from that it's a pretty good game IF you warn folks to expect an extremely constricted & luck-based last few turns during which they must be prepared to immediately eliminate unplayable dice from consideration in order to choose from the best of the remaining (usually bad) options quickly. Otherwise endgame can easily devolve into whining & AP (analysis paralysis). Endgame luck is occasionally ever so slightly mitigateable, but only in advance through careful planning. The 1.93 \"weight\" rating must be for those who just react turn by turn. If you plan way ahead early with some statistical probability analysis there's kind of a lot to chew on here. For me the main trick to actually enjoying this game is to, every turn, immediately start eliminating bad choices until i've shrunk my decision space to a manageable size.\n",
      "This makes me surprised that the target demographic isn't narrower. Those obsessed with optimizing turns might be chronically frustrated by how thoroughly luck can stymie their most flexible plans, but it's too heavy for folks who don't like having to burn their brains to play competently. That leaves folks (like me) who don't mind failing miserably pretty often despite pretty flawless optimal play... it gives less precise thinkers the chance for an occasional win despite pretty crunchy circumstances!\n",
      "Oh & i almost forgot... a variety of very different common goals from game to game keeps things interesting.\n",
      "-Ever since covid struck i've kicked myself for not keeping Sagrada. It's a great solo game if u don't mind getting hooked on something that regularly makes you yell at it!\n",

My biggest knock against the game is the lack of interaction. The game will end and someone will have the most points, but there's no leader during the game to rally against, and it's rarely worth your time to hinder someone. Azul is similar and offers spite drafting.\n",

It is not always possible to fill out the card by the end of the game. Master's Tools, which allow you to steal cubes from your opponents, add an extra level of competition and can lead to fierce battles. In general, the game is more complex and deeper than it seems.

      "\n",
      "Each round, players draft dice from a central pool (two per round), using a snake draft. Once dice are drafted, players place them in their \"window\" following specific placement rules all while trying to achieve public and personal goals to score points. After ten rounds, each players 4x5 window should be populated with 20 dice (providing placement rules could be met), and the person with the most victory points wins.\n",

      "There are opportunities to break rules based on some of the \"tools\" in the game, but this will be limited based on individual\"window\" difficulty.\n",

      "The app is great fun as well , and is colourblind friendly. I also purchased some additional transparent dice with sparkles for red (to distinguish it from green) and blue (to distinguish it from purple) for use in the physical game to make it more colourblind friendly as well.\n",
      "Comentario: I am more of a board gamer and was hesitant to try a dice game. I really enjoyed this game and would call it more of a puzzle game than a dice game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the game is visually stunning. The colors and design of the dice and the player boards are simply beautiful, and it adds a level of enjoyment to the game that is hard to beat. But beyond the aesthetics, the gameplay is also incredibly engaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puzzle mechanic of the game is relatively easy to understand, which makes it accessible to players of all levels. You are essentially placing dice on your board, trying to match the color and number requirements for each slot, while also trying to create specific patterns to score points. It's just enough of a challenge to get your brain working hard, but not so much that it creates a headache.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there were times when I found myself frustrated because I didn't have a play, but looking back, I realized that I should have kept some of my skill tokens to help overcome these obstacles. This is a lesson I learned the hard way, but it adds an element of strategy to the game that I really enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would highly recommend Sagrada to anyone looking for a fun and engaging puzzle game. The beautiful design and accessible gameplay make it a great choice for game nights with friends or family, and the added challenge of managing your skill tokens keeps the game interesting and engaging even after multiple playthroughs.\n",
      "Comentario: My first solo game (other than solitaire)! I bought it because it's pretty and I find it medatitive. It actually looks like the Sagrada cathedral windows I enjoy rolling and placing the dice. I don't like the 'tool' cards as some of them just don't make sense (or aren't particularly helpful!)

The final scoring heavily relies on luck and the randomness of the dice drawn. As players, we may put in a lot of effort to carefully plan and strategize throughout the game, only to be hampered by unfavorable dice rolls. This element of luck can sometimes lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction, as it seems to diminish the impact of skillful play.\n",

      "I initially thought that Sagrada and Azul looked super similar, and Sagrada is prettier, so I went with it. Later I found Azul for a super cheap price ($9!) and bought several copies as gifts. After playing it, they are quite different, despite both involving drafting and placing square objects (dice/tiles) into a square grid. I think Sagrada is a lot less mean than Azul. I don't usually pay as much attention to other players' boards in Sagrada as I do in Azul. This is a more relaxing and less confrontational game. Kind of a multiplayer solitaire feel to it. Though you can and will definitely take the dice someone else wants and they will do the same to you. You really just take the dice that help you the most here, whereas there is a lot more taking the tiles you can use that will hurt the other player the most in Azul.\n",

This game has gotten far more plays than I'd expect. I really enjoy the solo game as well; though easy to win, it provides a good element of decision making (using low dice to get a low AI score vs using that dice to score more than the AI with risk). Since I prefer games with more theme and story, this is a very high rating from me. I don't see it losing score over time either. Fantastic game.\n",

      "Comentario: I wanted to like this game: gorgeous, thinky, drafty, dicey. However, for me the experience is boring and overthinky. These may sound like polar opposites, but somehow the game manages exactly that. Overthinky comes down to having so complex interactions on your own board that it's unpleasant to even try to interact with other players. A special mention goes to the terrible design and iconography on the tool cards. Not sure if this mediocre game will stay in my collection.\n",

      "Comentario: Got Azul and Sagrada at the same time. Both are similar games. Ultimately, I think preference comes down to how much random variation you prefer in your games. Sagrada has a bit more random variability in that you randomly pick the color of the dice (similar to Azul), but then also have to roll the dice for random numbers. And then Sagrada also has randomized starting templates to fill out, random private & public goals, and the random \"tool\" cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me personally, I'll give a slight edge to Sagrada, since I like a bit more variability - it helps with replayability. You are a bit more at the mercy of the dice and random-ness, but I'm ok with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like how it isn't too hard to play this with my 6-year-old son. With him, we play without the \"tool\" cards - they aren't that important anyways. (The \"tool\" cards are the only thing that requires any reading.) And since scoring is at the end (as opposed to every round in Azul), we can just help him with that at the end of the game. (He is also now playing Azul with us, with help from us.)\n",
      "\n",
      "One issue is that it is easy for a dice to get bumped, and it can be hard to remember what it was supposed to be. And one dice being bumped can be fairly significant. (Even dice placed in the player board thingy can get messed up easily, nut just rolled dice waiting to be picked.) In one game, it may have been a 7 point difference, which would have altered the winner of the game.\n",

With all the dice, it gives me That’s Pretty Clever vibes, but since the scoring method is different they fee like totally different games even though the mechanic is almost the same (in TPC you get scored on five different reigns and you get multiples of your smallest one).\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m liking Sagrada due to the replayability it has. Your board is different each time you play. Patterns you get scoring on is different each time. Also you have additionally a private scoring as well. In TPC, it’s about figuring out best line possible in the game then tactically try to figure out how to reach it with the random dice you’re given and the super moves you’re given to try and even your luck (in TPC, you’re allowed limited re-rolls and limited extra dice usage).\n",

      "Comentario: Sagrada remains a simple, intuitive and beautiful dice-drafting game, easy to teach and something both gamers and non-gamers would enjoy. The game does have some moderate problems, most notably that the clear plastic dice aren't very color-blind friendly (in particular, telling green from blue is difficult in some lighting). Also, the various tools feel a tad wonky. Still a modern classic though, and great for killing time while latecomers are arriving.\n",

      "Comentario: 12/22: Actually ended up playing it a lot more in 2022 & came to really appreciate it. It's terrible at large player counts, but I love it at 2 players and at that count, I do prefer it to Azul for my braindead days. Raising rating. 6/18: Lovely game, but I unfortunately encountered it after playing both Roll Player and Azul. Sagrada has elements of both and doesn't really have enough individuality for me to own it while owning those two. Dice drafting & arrangement is done better in Roll Player, which is a deeper & more interesting game, although considerably heavier than Sagrada. It's also more thematic and the idea of powers is taken far further, to great effect. On the other hand, for a light abstract that requires you to draft and score for patterns.. Azul is the better choice because the rules are far more intuitive (Sagrada's rules, while few, are notoriously unintuitive and easy to misplay). Azul is streamlined, aesthetically appealing, deep, but easy to teach. Ironically, Azul and Roll Player are very different from each other... but somehow, by falling between those two, the pleasant and colorful Sagrada just ends up falling short for me.\n",

The beginning feels easy, until you realize that you boxed a section so that you need a single color/number combo on a die or that you accidentally ruined a row/column you were making for a scoring condition. Easy to learn and easy to play. Mostly solitaire-like feel with drafting element (only player interaction is through the draft). Tools allow for some dice manipulation and variety.\n",

      "Comentario: This is a game that can be a real challenge. It doesn't have that many rules, but it imposes just enough restrictions that completely filling your window with dice can be a challenge. I like the dice drafting mechanism, and how it puts you in those difficult decisions where you have to choose what you need most from the available options. As with any game that uses small dice, I do wish there was a version of this game with full-size dice, because these are often hard for people with fat fingers to maneuver into spots in the middle of their board. Otherwise, this game is a true delight. I love the variety in the window patterns and the different goals in the game. But more than anything, I'm always impressed with how fast it plays. This is a nice brisk hour or less, and always makes for a satisfying play every time.\n",

I prefer to be given a set of goals to meet and be allowed to accomplish those goals using any space I want. I feel like Sagrada forces me to make bad plays because of the luck of the roll combined with the available placements. For example, I have to play either a red or a 3 (independent of end goals), but only one dice rolled meets either requirement, forcing me to take that dice even if that screws up something else. I know this type of thing happens with all these types of games, but there is something different about the way Sagrada does it I just don't like.\n",

      "Comentario: What new-to-you games have you played lately? We’ve recently tried Sagrada, an abstract game in which players draft dice in order to fill up their stained glass windows boards, in an attempt to maximize the number of points provided by public and private objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each game of Sagrada has players tuck in the middle of the board a card with a certain pattern that affects the dice that they can add to their boards. Some spaces have to be occupied by dice of certain colors of values, and no 2 dice of the same color and value can ever be orthogonally adjacent. Plus, you have to place all your dice in a way that ensures that they are adjacent (either diagonally or orthogonally) to already-placed dice. Besides that, each player has at their disposal some skill tokens, that they can use in order to activate tools (which usually break some established rules or allow you to change the value of the dice that you place).\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the restrictions entailed by these cards, what dice you draft is also going to be influenced by the objectives used in that game. They get scored multiple times, depending on the degree to which you fulfill them. Some are very straightforward – having sets of dice valued 1 and 2 for instance. Others require more forward-planning: having dice of different values on a row or of different colors on a column.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arc of the game is quite interesting – it starts very relaxing, but by the middle of the game you have to think very carefully about what dice you draft and where you place them, as you can get stuck. You’ll want to add as many dice as you can to your board, as empty spaces are worth negative points at the end of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s plenty of variety provided by the pattern cards and the public objectives, but where the game could have use much more variety is with the private objectives. They all function in the same way: add up the value of dice of a certain color, and the sum represents the points that you get for that card. Although this was probably meant to reduce randomness and ensure that players have similar conditions to fulfill, our preference is usually for more varied scorings.\n",

      "I liked this quite a bit, but I have a few little issues with it. I really enjoyed the components. The windows are lovely to look at and the cards that slide into them are genius. The dice are small, but well made. The card quality is OK, but they aren't handled all that much, so no big deal there.\n",
      "\n",
      "My issues with the game have to do with the window cards themselves and the bonus cards. You can get a window that requires 6 of a certain color but not get that color as your hidden bonus card. I know other colors can go in the window, but it still seemed kind of wonky to me. My other issue was with the tool cards. They seemed to be overpowered for one player but underpowered for the other player. Example: we had the card that lets you place a die not adjacent to another die. Brian was having terrible issues connecting his dice early so he used this card and really ran away with the game. I didn't need the card early but by the time I could have used it, the game was decided.\n",

Colored dice are drafted and used to create a stained glass window using a pattern and rules for placing the colors and numbers. \"Tool cards\" can be used at expense of end-game points to break some rules on occasion. Rules are easy to learn but the game is thinky due to the placement requirements. This is a great gateway games to teach those new to gaming. Plus, the window displays created with the dice are very pretty to look at. Highly recommended.\n",

Using dice as pieces of the \"stained glass window\" you are crafting is a clever device that helps simulate the idea of really wielding stained glass windows.

I have never liked nor played much solitaire, but even if I had, the solo variant of Sagrada would have undoubtedly replaced it. Given its enjoyment at all player-counts, it's filler-length, and it's chill nature this bedazzling gem gets plenty of playtime under our roof.\n",

Azul may \"look\" better - in that the tiles are very pretty on the table. But this offers me a more rewarding experience. It's just enough of a challenge that it gets my puzzle-liking brain going. but it's also simple enough that I can play it casually, with little risk of not having a good time.\n",

      "Comentario: This game is quick, fun, and great looking. Themed around the famous \"Sagrada Familia\", players each have their own stained glass window to build. They do this by drafting translucent colored die and placing them next to die on their boards. There are a couple rules to this though; two of the same value can't touch, and two of the same color can't touch. Each board also has certain spots designated as a certain value or color. Players have 3 common objectives that score points and 1 secret color for which they get points for all pips on die of that color in their board.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a lot that I like about this game, and once I have played with more than 2, if it is just as good that way my rating will likely go up even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the components are great! Each players board is nice and thick, and has a slot to put the different board cards into for variability. Also, the dice each have their own slot so there is no fear of jostling ruining your game. The dice are simple but look great and really make your board pop out at the end and look like you've truly made your very own stained glass window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the gameplay is engaging and has just enough interaction for a game that is very puzzle-y. Players do a snake draft for the die and sometimes players will take that one die you really needed, but there are tool cards players can use to help mitigate this. It really does feel like a puzzle that is interesting, without being brain-burning or AP inducing. It's almost like a game of sudoku using numbers and colors, and the different possible goals give that extra guidance to really make you try to be somewhat optimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the game does just enough rules-wise and in play-length without overstaying it's welcome on either account. I really have to applaud the designer for this. It takes a solid half-hour and maybe five minutes to teach. Honestly, I can't think of another game (for me personally) that gives me a better feeling of playing a full, fleshed out game, and having it clock in at 30-40 minutes. The first couple of times I felt like I had played a solid hour game, but really it took the two of us about 25 minutes!\n",

Sagrada is the newest for me and still has me figuring out the best strategies. The different objectives and tools make each play more unique in comparison to Azul. Azul, however, feels more like a game where you can outsmart the other more and be more mean while drafting, which makes it more of a skill-based game for me where the better player usually wins. I think the, for me very slightly superior, look and feel of Sagrada combined with the different avenues to win and the different \"rules\" in each game would give this the slight edge over Azul. It would be a difference of 9 to 9.1, so both are excellent in my opinion.\n",

Players then take 2 dice (one at a time, switch-back style) and place them on their boards. Dice must be placed touching a previously placed die and following whatever rule is shown on the card (e.g., only a specific color or number), and must be different in both color and number from every orthogonal die. They can spend their chips (they got 3-5 at start, depending on which board they chose) to use the rule-breaker cards. After all dice are allocated, tally your VP from the various sources; most VP wins!\n",

Maybe too simplistic? It has a very large box for a pretty small game. I think the public objectives are kind of boring. We always play with the colors/numbers per row/collumn, we don't like the other ones. The private objective secret color is kind of fun, but in no time it is known what player wants what color and it is good for scoring many many (too many?) points. So for now it's a 6.

      "Comentario: A game that works well as a low complexity intro game for new people but also is complex enough to engage those that prefer really strategic games. It gets a little repetitive for me but I enjoy playing it.\n",
      "Comentario: w/ 6 player expansion.\n",

      "Comentario: I have this game because I sometimes play with people who aren't really board gamers. However, I find it somewhat dull. Lots of waiting and then you don't always get what you want. I've been told that the expansions really bring this game to life, but I don't have firsthand experience there.\n",
      "Comentario: An interesting game combining the strategy of drafting with the luck of the dice. The game is beautiful to look at between the colors of the dice and the windows you are building toward, but it's also quick to play (regardless of how many players you have) and can be handicapped based on how skilled each player is. The tool system is also great, as you typically don't need them until late in the game, but wait too long, and the price goes up, potentially to something you can't afford. There is also a solo variant if you can't find others to play with!\n",
      "\n",
      "My knock against the game is that the dice are so tiny that they have a tendency to go all over the place, and, although the game is competitive, I get the feeling it's largely just focusing on your own thing and not really interacting with other players.\n",
      "Comentario: Very fun and challenging abstract game. I like abstract games, and I like dice rolling. Sagrada combines both into an extremely fun game. This one will force you into some difficult decisions late in the game. Expansion to 6 players is highly recommended. Another keeper.\n",
      "Comentario: Pretty intriguing puzzle but too solitary.\n",
      "Comentario: Sleeved\n",
      "Comentario: much better multiplayer than original solo mode, however there is an Automa variant I need to try at some point\n",
      "Comentario: It’s beautiful and I want to love it, but the randomness just kills it. Last game I played, my opponent had several blue and green bonus objectives, whereas I had red and yellow bonus objectives. The last four turns of the game, not a single red or yellow dice appeared, and two of the turns had 4 greens and 4 blues respectively. I lost badly and it felt completely out of my control.\n",

      "Comentario: very fun light dice drafting game. Feels like sudoku, you will try to figure out 5x4 grid to create most beautiful window (read to score the most points according to current objectives and your hidden objective).\n",
      "Dice placement has several restrictions (which differs based on the player board you choose) so it is a puzzle to pick the optimal dice, to choose a place to put it on and to decide whether a tool should be used for different effect.\n",
      "I am not stunned by the visual beauty of the game as most other people - what I see is just colored dice on (OK, very nice) window like board. But it doesn't mean I am not excited for the game alone. It seems I really enjoy the lighter family games to be played under 30 minutes and this game is no exception and very quickly become a staple on our game table.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I like:\n",
      "- Dice drafting and placement. The placement restrictions are really easy to grasp, but are cleverly designed and it resulted in a light brain-burny style of puzzle game which is somehow thinky yet very lighthearted and friendly.\n",
      "- I like the optimization of every single move, when you try to fill the most problematic places and keep so much options for future rounds as able. Also working with different public objectives adds another layer to this puzzle, really appreciate this.\n",
      "- I like the theme of the game and its implementation in otherwise abstract themeless game. The visual aspect along with the theme does its job in promoting this game\n",
      "\n",
      "What I dislike:\n",
      "- Despite of existing solo variant, this game mode is very luck dependant (depends on goals and dice throws much more than multiplayer game). But this game is really not solo game, the solo option is just a welcomed addition (and I still enjoy it from time to time, its quicker than multiplayer games)\n",
      "- I would like to see more public objective cards, maybe some interesting tools (hopefully these will be added in future expansion)\n",
      "- This is really a small game, I don't see the point of having this big box (aside of nice functional insert). The game would fit in half sized box.\n",
      "- sometimes when trying to put (or remove) a dice from the grid can accidentally flip some other dice around. As the dice are relatively small, the manipulation with them could be sometimes flimsy.\n",

      "Comentario: It's a nice game but I must admit, even after quite a few round, this has not really caught on. I like to play it once in a while, but with so many better games in my collection, it only gets brought to the table as variation.\n",
      "Comentario: Wife, daughters, and friends all think this is pretty good. I can't disagree. I generally like heavier games, but if they're happy, I'm happy!\n",

      "Edit: This is such a peaceful, casual, puzzle of a game... It is definitely a great game if you're just hanging out with \"mild\" gamers who just want to sip wine, have snacks, and just talk while playing something.\n",

      "Comentario: Love it\n",
      "Comentario: Absolutely love playing this with the wife, despite us both playing our own board, there's definitely a competitive edge to it ensuring no placement is wasted.\n",
      "Comentario: Very fine materials. The player-boards got the shapes of church windows with a small slot in the bottom where you put in the ordercards for every game. There are tools to use in a match and public orders which each player can fullfill in this match. The eyecatchers are the coloured and glasslike dice.\n",
      "Comentario: Sagrada is great. Very fun puzzle to solve. I think the digital version is very well done too.\n",
      "Comentario: fun. reminds me of azul style but with dice rolling. If your a dice fan i highly recommend this. Its a patter matching game. It would be nice if the bonus cards could be gained more of but i think the expansion handles this. Very high quality components. the only downsize i found was the boards could have been slightly bigger as i had a little trouble fitting dice in the middle of the board when surrounded by other dice.\n",
      "Comentario: Very fun...but the aspect of the roll of the dice, gives a tactical limitation, which at times is frustrating\n",

      "Comentario: Very easy to teach, quick setup, beautiful game, simple rules but interesting enough. The duration is perfect\n",
      "Comentario: Not for the color-blind - or those who dislike puzzles. Sagrada seems like a light dice-placement game but the restrictions on placement, which are sometimes eased by the tools, make it quite brain-burning.\n",
      "Comentario: Rating with roulette and 6 player expansion. Love this game so much.\n",
      "Comentario: Light strategy using dice as panes of glass in a stained glass window. Utilizes a set of objectives to outline win conditions, so easily replayable.\n",
      "Comentario: Making stained glass windows with dice. A very similar game to Blueprints. The big difference is that in Blueprints, for a given scoring category only the player with the best tower gets the points, leading to potentially very lopsided games. Here it's more traditional, you get points based on how good your windows is, and then compare at the end.\n",

      "Comentario: More of a puzzle than a game, really. I like the drafting, but in most cases, what you need relative to your opponents is arbitrary. It's pleasant and attractive, but rarely compelling to me.\n",
      "Comentario: Há muito que estava curioso em experimentar \"Sagrada\", mas depois de finalmente o jogar, ficou a sensação de que esperava que fosse ainda melhor. É de facto um jogo agradável e colorido, que faz lembrar \"Azul\" fundido com \"Blueprints\", embora seja impossível tal inspiração, pois \"Azul\" é exatamente do mesmo ano...\n",

I’ve gotten so many of my friends hooked on this game. It’s relaxing and challenging but doesn’t feel competitive. I love that all the cards are inspired by real stained glass windows- we enjoy looking up our play cards in real life after we’ve completed them. I’ve taught this game to ages ranging from a friends’ eight year old to my 80s climbing grandma and everyone loves it by the end of their first play through. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n",

You have to make sure you get a lot of high numbers of your color if you want any chance to win. Not always sure it is worth the extra clear tokens to use cards for the complexity it adds to the dice placement. I usually just do that so I have a great challenge instead of trying to win.\n",

      "Comentario: In this whole Sagrada vs Azul war, Sagrada obviously wins. Easily. (If you think differently, you are very wrong.) It's just more of a gamer's game. Azul is fine, but it definitely has a winning strategy, and once everyone figures it out, it becomes less enjoyable. Everybody's doing the same thing so everybody knows everybody's strategy. The different public objectives in Sagrada make each game different. Plus, the whole thing just comes off like a particularly beautiful game of competitive Sudoku.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest problem with Sagrada, though, is the lack of GOOD scoring cards. I don't even play with the secret color cards anymore, as they can literally be the difference between winning and losing. These are where the most points are, so if you aren't getting 5s or 6s in that color, then you're going to lose. Many of the public objectives are practically useless. Like the ones which reward you for using certain numbers. Everyone is going for them, so everyone tends to score the same amount. It seems like the Façade expansions may solve some of this, but I'm not a huge fan of costly expansions when all you really need are a few new cards.\n",

Storage and component quality excellent (except the scoring counters; a bit tiny and hard to read. I use colored stones as a replacement for favor tokens that way players know what tools they have already purchased.. just as a tracker, but everyone loves that personal touch. CONS: tools seem a bit ambiguous or are not easy to interpret (recommend an appendix with tool cards listed and examples of actions drafters can take with each tool); NOT color-blind friendly, (recommend iconography to replace dice pips-may not be worth the cost..I dunno)> I love this game and it's easy to teach!!!\n",

      "Comentario: Learnability: The game isn't the hardest to learn, but it's not the easiest either. I'd say it is fairly middle of the road. The rules are easy, but it is the rules on the cards that let you fix mistakes which end up getting most first time players confused. The best way to learn is by giving players a quick run down prior and going over steps as they come up. On average, for the people I've played with anyway, it takes about fifteen minutes for someone to get comfortable with the rules the first time they play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complexity: The game can be as complex or as simple as you'd like it to be. Each card has a difficulty rating at the bottom and that allows you to choose how much of a challenge you want to give yourself. The harder the card, the more complex your personal game will be. Even on the easy cards there is still a sense of complexity. As you never know what dice will be rolled of what number and what color. Also, the more players that play the harder getting the dice you want becomes. Other players can totally screw someone over just by taking a certain die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replay Value: The game has good potential for replay value to a certain degree. The RNG of the dice being rolled, what bonus color you pull, the bonus scoring cards, and mistake fixing cards add a pretty random feeling. You should never get the same exact set up twice. It's impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Thoughts: The design is beautiful and it's a great puzzle game. You want to get the best score against your friends so that you can win. So there is a competitive aspect to it. If you like thinking games and puzzles then you should really enjoy this. Even if you aren't a huge fan of those, the artwork and overall design of stained glass is so gorgeous that I'd say it is worth to pick up. Just to have it aesthetically for your collection.\n",
      "Comentario: Nice, chill game to bust out. I don't mind this one feeling like a multiplayer solitaire, because I purposefully play it like that. It's really just fun to see how good of a score you can get, and when I play with my girlfriend, we'll try to avoid picking up a dice someone else needs if we can get the same points by choosing something else.\n",

      "Comentario: Sagrada est de ces jeux qui attirent le regard : l’idée de construire les vitraux de la Sagrada Familia à l’aide de dés qui en représenteraient les différents verres colorés sert de splendide prétexte abstrait à une splendeur éditoriale, des dés eux-mêmes aux plateaux/vitraux dans lesquels on insère les motifs et sur lesquels on dispose les verres, produisant une très jolie composition chromatique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un thème assez universel pour un jeu assez consensuel, au bon sens du terme, misant beaucoup sur un étonnant calibrage entre accessibilité et cérébralité. Un peu comme Azul ou Calico, Sagrada sait continuellement investir les joueurs dans chaque moment de la partie, dès la mise en place, puis imposer juste ce qu’il faut de réflexion pour que l’on se sente libre et responsable de ses choix (d’autant que la gestion des outils/faveurs permet de contourner en partie le hasard) sans risquer une analysis-paralysis qui serait contraire à sa philosophie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sagrada ajoute à son élégance une volonté assez forte de rejouabilité : loin de se contenter de varier les parties grâce au seul tirage des dés, il les renouvelles avec le changement continuel des motifs, outils, objectifs privés et publics. Il atteint ainsi parfaitement ses objectifs : offrir à un public familial un jeu malin, fluide, très beau et varié - et d'ailleurs reconnu comme 11ème meilleur jeu abstrait et 23ème meilleur jeu familial de tous les temps sur BGG.\n",

      "Comentario: I love the art and components. I enjoy playing this at 2, because of how quick the games are. I like the balance of luck and the ability to mitigate said luck. I do not enjoy the solo rules, although they are simple, because they just present a very stressful puzzle, in my opinion. Scoring is also weird a bit, with the personal objective being worth a lot more that the public ones, but it's alright anyway.\n",

      "Comentario: Sagrada is a light and colorful dice-drafting game with pleasant aesthetics and components! A unique concept, the player places colored dice on their individual board representing an artist crafting a masterful stained glass window. The player positions the dice to match as accurate as possible to their chosen window pattern, while also trying to incorporate other patterns in order to maximize victory points. It's reminiscent of a paint-by-numbers, except the resources (dice) are limited and shared between the players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much like paint-by-numbers, Sagrada can be a very relaxing experience, which is a refreshing change of pace from other stress-inducing tabletop games. Although this game does require strategy and adaption, the gameplay is generally laid-back. The rules are straightforward. The pacing is even (the gameplay does not slog on, nor does it race by too quickly). There is light interaction between the players, as all players are drafting from the same dice pool; so, turn order and timing are extremely important. However, there are no direct confrontations (i.e. you can't block or deny other players from making a move).\n",
      "\n",
      "The dice are front-and-center in this game! Dice are usually a mere random number generator in most games (easily replaceable with another type of randomizer), but here the dice go beyond this. They act as the main building block for completing your objective (your beautiful stained glass window), which is a creative twist on a usually overlooked component in tabletop games.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, with any game having a significant number of random generators, Sagrada can suddenly become difficult when misfortune occurs, leading to some frustration. So, players succeed the most when they can adapt to these misfortunes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend playing Sagrada to those seeking a short/medium-length light game that is a bit more clever than traditional party games. This is a great title for families and casual gamers. During a gaming marathon, this is also a great option to mix-in with longer, more complex titles.\n",
      "Comentario: Satisfying\n",

      "Comentario: It's a neat game that isn't hard to learn and doesn't take too long to play. It'd be a good game for less serious gamers who aren't going to be into games with 15 page instruction books. For me and my friends, it was alright. Nothing amazing but I could see pulling it out occasionally when looking for a quickish game with little to no setup.\n",

      "Comentario: Fun to play and very colourful game. Sometimes you feel that pressure to get a dice of your choice.\n",
      "Comentario: Simple nice drafting and placement game that can be played with almost everyone, provided one is aware of some basic corner cases that should have been tackled more clearly in the rulebook. Great components, except from the tool cards whose design to me looks substandard. Has quite some luck, but then it's a quick puzzle game so that's ok. Not much confrontational, overall a joy to play and a looker. Plays well solo too (see my simple variant in the variants forum).\n",

      "Comentario: Quick and easy to grasp the basics. Feels more like you are playing yourself than against others. Good gateway game. I also incorporate the 5-6 Player expansion which adds a personal dice pools quickening game play. Awful thinky, so best played with non AP prone individuals.\n",
      "Comentario: The first time we played this it was with six people. Won’t do that again I think. However, with three or four, this game finds it’s sweet spot. There will be AP for those that are prone to it.\n",
      "Comentario: Not sure I want to keep this game. It’s great looking, well made, but it feels like a solitaire type game.\n",

      "Comentario: Fun and relaxing game. Not much player interaction and limited and repetitive personal goals make the game somewhat flat.\n",
      "Comentario: Extremely fun and strategic dice-placement game. Easy to learn and play and has plenty of variety. Really enjoy playing this with my wife!\n",
      "Comentario: A very deceptive game. First rounds can make you think it's a relaxing sudoku derivative, but when there's less room for the dice in your board it really gets tense. I still consider it's a relaxing game, but I don't think is as light as it might seem at first glance\n",

      "Comentario: Dice-rolling abstract made beautiful and \"worth it\" for a guy who really digs theme above most other things. Quick and fun for the whole family.\n",
      "Comentario: I really enjoy Sagrada; especially at higher player counts. Not only is it a very eye-catching abstract, but the game play is super intuitive. It does play somewhat solitaire-like, but the die drafting piece does make it feel interactive. I do wish there was more variability in bonus cards.\n",
      "Comentario: Fantastic looking game and always fun to play. Often compared to Azul as a similar style family game. I think that this will appeal to anyone who likes Azul as it's essentially placing dice to create patterns with certain restrictions, same as in Azul. I personally think that Azul has a better game mechanic, with Sagrada having a more significant luck element to it, but it's great fun\n",

      "Comentario: Sagrada is a beautiful dice-drafting game. The different scoring public and secret cards increases the replayability. The variety of windows difficulty also make the game interesting. The solo variant is very fun but brutal at the same time. The game plays quickly and there's basically no set-up time, which is a great thing when playing with my girlfriend. Luck is a HUGE factor in this game as you need to pick the right color to fill your specific window restrictions AND roll the appropriate value.\n",
      "Comentario: A surprisingly thematic game for what initially looks like an abstract puzzle game about making stained glass windows. The luck of the dice can dictate the direction of the game, especially with 2 players where you don't see all the dice.\n",

Usually seems best to draft for yourself and hate only when there are no good selections. Can be difficult to use tools because dice cover board requirements. I have fat fingered a bunch of dice off the board before and I am scrawny. Fiddly late game checking spots.\n",

Lots of fun, even my wife (who I wasn't sure would enjoy it, as typically she doesn't enjoy word/numbers games as much) really liked it and even suggested we keep playing. I expect it to be a winner at my house for years to come, I am looking forward to owning the expansion!

We are also not required to think too much (no analysis paralysis!) and get punished right away nor think too little and get bored.\n",

      "Updated thoughts: Some new players might find this game frustrating. In general, it feels very restrictive. As you play, you are constantly navigating a series of restrictions as you try to place your dice in the most effective way. New players easily grasped the placement restrictions printed on the board. Likewise the orthogonally matching restrictions (same colors / same numbers cannot touch sides) make sense and seems logical. However, when these two sets of restrictions come together, it can be really frustrating to figure out how to get the dice to fit. One of our players rage quit and probably wouldn't play the game again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you get the right dice that you need. Other times, the process of analyzing the dice feels like a series of disappointments: If I place this there, it might make things difficult later in the game; if I place this there, I won't be able to place one next to it later; if I place this there, then I won't be able to score any points for this row; if I place this there, then there will be an empty spot at the end of the game; I can't place this one there or there, but if I had to it can go here; I can't place this anywhere, but I could use that tool to move that one and then place this one there; I can't place any of these dice anywhere and I have to skip my turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The placement system gives the game depth, but the result is not something I find particularly fun. It provides satisfaction more as a challenge than something that is fun. In our games, we're sat together in silence running through the many options each turn. The downtime in this game can be unsatisfying, as it takes quite a long time to make it back to your turn when your are the first player when playing a four player game. It's also to difficult to plan in advance because you can't really predict what other player will choose, so most of the time spent in between your turns is wasted. Not being able to plan much in advance makes it even more difficult for players who tend to get analysis paralysis and everyone waiting on them makes it worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the components can be a source of frustration for some. I appreciate the double-layer game boards with recesses for the dice (something I wish Azul had). However, the small dice and compact arrangement on the board might be difficult to use. When the board starts to get full, it is easy to accidentally knock a die out of place. If you forget what number it was or even where it went, this can mess up the entire game. People with shaky hands or thicker fingers might have trouble especially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice components (cards feel a bit flimsy though), pretty game, nice box insert, easy to teach, visually appealing to new players / non-gamers, smooth gameplay, scales number of players well, solo mode, scoring requires a bit of calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there are some similarities with Azul, the gameplay experience is sufficiently different to me. Sagrada has a more multi-player solitaire feel, with each player trying to do their best at their own puzzle. Azul can be quite competitive and even cut-throat at times, where you're working on your own puzzle, but also considering how the other players will act—whether to sabotage them or compel them to act in a way that benefits you by also benefiting them. The extra bit of randomness and shorter rounds in Sagrada make it more tactical, forcing players to make the best of the situation, whereas in Azul the information is a bit more stable making it possible to run through a number of strategic scenarios for the round in your head. In Azul, much of the game can be about looking at the other player's boards, and in one decisive move you could make a turn quite difficult for them. I like that the scoring in Azul happens throughout the game, and the way it goes up and down creates interesting tension, at the end of the game there's not much calculating to do and you can quickly tell who won. In Sagrada, you add up scores at the end and compare numbers, which is not quite as exciting to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't mind the multi-player solitaire aspect or added randomness of Sagrada, to me this gives the game a different feel, either game suited for a different mood or group.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also appreciate the solo mode of Sagrada. It's a peaceful, puzzley way to spend some time.\n",

      "Comentario: This is a great game and on it's own and we enjoy it, but rarely play without the expansion. The expansion adds a spot for your own personal dice supply that you can play from. To be honest with so many abstract games out there, we prefer a couple of them over this one. So unfortunately this game doesn't hit the table as much as it used to, but it's still a keeper.\n",

This takes the \"roll and write\" formula (roll dice, fill out spaces while keeping other spaces open for future rolls), but actually makes it into a compelling, more strategic game.

With this and Roll Player released last year, I am really digging this new genre of dice game.\n",

      "At the beginning of the game, every player deceides for one window grid. The grid tells you essential restrictions that you need to consider when placing a die, either about the color, or the die value. All players share three common goal cards, e.g.\"Have a die of different value in each column\". During each round, a number of die are rolled. Players select a die, place it in their grid. After 10 rounds, the player with the most victory points is the winner.\n",

      "Comentario: Great, fast thinky game. This seems like it’s the standard for dice drafting games that all others should now be compared against. The random draw of public scoring objectives and tools (special abilities you’ll get to use a few times during the game) makes each play feel different. You can also choose whether to use or not use the private scoring cards (which just makes you want to maximize total pips of a specific color). BGG seems to prefer it with 2 when you have the most control, but I wonder if that’s because players are spending a lot of time looking at opponents’ boards and hate drafting. I like to play it like the other players’ boards are hidden, and prefer it with 3-4. The solo game sucks - a really bad random puzzle that feels like a waste of brain cells.\n",

      "Comentario: Super quick and easy to learn. A great gateway game. The objective cards that encourage you to place the dice in specific patterns add an element of challenge and strategy. Only criticism is that there is a slight lack of player interaction - one mechanic of this game is to keep an eye on what other people are doing and try to block them by taking the dice they need. But there are so many objectives to meet, and strict rules as to where you can place your own dice, that you’re just focusing on completing your own window and it feels as though everyone is playing their own game. Still great fun though and something I’ll play if I don’t feel very competitive and want to chill.\n",

I had never even heard of it when I saw it on the shelf, and it ended up being the hit of vacation. It scratches that pattern building itch of games like patchwork, which my wife loves, but it has more to it to keep me interested, with the 3 random objectives each game and random dice pulls/rolls which give you new decisions each turn. It reminds me slightly of a mix between patchwork and Blueprints, but for for now this is my favorite game of the 3, easily.

      "Comentario: My rating for the original game with the original rules and original private objectives cannot be more than 6. The original private objectives are quite poor, as they all are of collecting dice of some certain colour to get as many points as there are pips on them. Those dice colour objectives also don't support public row colour objectives very much, as you must avoid having more than one die per colour in one row. Also, when there are 2 or 3 players, it's possible that your private colour dice are not pulled out of the bag as many times as other colours are, as there are 90 dice in the bag regardless of the player count.\n",

I don´t see myself playing Sagrada with more than 4 players. In your turn you have to pick a die and use it the best way you can, this is a fun decision, but not really hard.

The fact that players are drafting from the dice pool results is what really sets it apart from other roll & writes and gives it an extra layer of strategy.\n",

It succeeds on so many levels. it is beautiful on the table, able to be played by experienced and new gamers, infinitely replayable, and the ability of players to choose cards of varying difficulty makes it uniquely suited for players of different skill levels to compete with each other on a more level playing field.

There are some concerns over the personal goals being over powered, but honestly I haven't felt screwed over by them in any of the handful of plays I've had. I love the look of the game, it really has amazing table presence, and it goes very quick but still gives you agonizing decisions as you get claustrophobically cornered in by just playing the game!

I enjoy the gameplay as you're drafting dice and trying to follow the rules of which dice can play where within your window. It takes some thinking and strategy, and is an enjoyable game.\n",
      "Comentario: I'm a big fan of dice drafting, and I love the puzzle element of how to best place your dice in the window. It's a great weight-level, light enough for non-gamers to enjoy while offering a decent amount of depth for those of us who like that. I also really enjoy the amount of variability of goals and tools, and it plays quickly - we can play a 3-game set in about an hour (2 players). Overall, this is a great game for me.\n",

      "Comentario: Beautiful looking game on the table with the colorful translucent dice. For a game that seems very solitaire-is on the surface, there's quite a bit of indirect interaction with the dice drafting and using the tools. It's exactly what I want in these abstract games since multiplayer solitaire games aren't my thing. Also I love the amount of variability with how every game scores differently and which tools will be available. Sagrada is the type of game that won't likely give me the itch to play but I'm always happy when I do.\n",

I enjoy the variety of scoring methods and this game seems to have a surprising amount of strategy. My only knock is that no matter how much you plan the dice can ruin your plans, there is some mitigation but, again, you only get a few of those options each game and the ones you get may not be the ones you really need.\n",

      "Comentario: A brain burning puzzle game that really has some great unique ideas with using dice as the glass of a cathedral. Stream line rules but has a vast amount of variety with the different tools and public projects. the hidden objectives give a nice long term strategy. Overall a surprise for me and a great game.\n",
      "Comentario: I absolutely loved this game when I first started playing it. after two months of owning it and playing it almost every game meetup, the game has started to feel pretty same-y. still, a very good game with a lot of play to it and I'd like to try other dice drafting games in the future.\n",
      "Comentario: Replay-ability: Having only recently played this game I think that it has a good replay value as there are many different window patterns in the base game and these paired with the variety of tool cards makes the game different each time. The fact that their is a random dice rolling mechanic that can change the shade of colours (different numbers) as well as different colours means that the likelihood of having similar rolls isn't that high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theme: This games theme revolves around creating stain glassed windows and does it deliver? Yes, yes it absolutely does! not only does it offer dice that are coloured but also explains how the number on the dice determines the shading of that colour. low numbers being lighter and high numbers darker it really makes you feel that you are creating a masterpiece. I would say that if the colour of the dice darkened depending on the number that would make it even better, but I really like the colouring of the dice as it is, giving that stained glass effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Difficulty: The difficulty of this game really depends on your window pattern cards as depending on the pips in the bottom right hand corner depends on how hard your game is going to be. Lower pips lower difficulty. This means that if you are playing with both adults and children you can adjust the difficulty for each player to make the game fairer. With that said Taking a difficult window pattern isn't all bad as you will get more favours to use on the tool cards. This makes the game more strategic for the harder patterns and easier to learn for the newer players taking the lower pip cards. The rulebook also has a good explaination of setup and scoring system with example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Thoughts: I personally feel this is a lovely game that is fun for all level of board gamers. It teaches the essential elements needed for other drafting games and is therefore a gateway game to other drafting games such as Azul, but is still fun. I do however feel that you do not need to put too much thought into a game, which is why I have only rated it a 7, greatover a pint but doesnt quite scratch my strategic itch.\n",
      "Comentario: This past weekend was my first experience with Sagrada and I really enjoyed playing it. I had never played a dice drafting game and I really enjoy that mechanic and the choices that it creates as you try to accomplish the game's objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also really enjoyed the game objective cards and that each game becomes a different game because the game objectives are different each time. Do you get rewarded for having colors in a diagonal line this game or having a row that has all five of the different colors? Depends on what card objectives are present for that game. This creates a lot of fun replayability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I really enjoyed the game. One negative I might say is that there are different windows that you can create that are more difficult than others. There is no bonus points for choosing a more difficult window other than you get more tokens to use for purchasing those tools powers. Seems like you should get more points at the end of the game for completing a more difficult window - but I have only played the game four times.\n",

      "I do enjoy the puzzle it has to offer: trying to keep plenty of options open while fulfilling the goals (private and public). It's certainly not mindless, most of the time there are at least several viable options and you CAN play skillfully (which means: doing everything you can to avoid bottlenecks - places on your board where you need very specific dice). So why do I enjoy \"Azul\" more? Because it's straightforward. \"Sagrada\" has some moving parts that are clunky and feel superfluous. Using tools in late part of the game can create downtime, whereas \"Azul\" has a very natural flow once you \"get\" the game. All in all, \"Sagrada\" is simply less elegant, but still entertaining. But if you want just one of the two, \"Azul\" is the one to go IMO.\n",

The drafting is less combative, so it's a little more loosey goosey. This I think is more fun with multiple players, as you can just all relax and build your windows. Azul is cutthroat--and that's great too, so it really depends on your mood.\n",

      "Comentario: Very simple to learn and teach, looks pretty on the table and very approachable. Variability is there with different goals, tools, and die rolls will always be different. My wife loves it and non-gamers are attracted to it so definitely a keeper.\n",
      "Comentario: Scratches the same dice-placement itch as Roll Player but in half the time.\n",
      "Comentario: Really pretty abstract game revolving around dice drafting and placement. One of those laid back games that plays quick and should provide an easy point of entry for a wide variety of gamers. May be too much of a multi-player solitaire for some.\n",
      "Comentario: My husband and I like Sagrada a lot. It offers straightforward rules, many interesting decisions, and a beautiful presence on the table.\n",
      "Comentario: Excellent thinky Sudoku-ish style game. Easy to teach.\n",

      "- Same number of dice of each color in the bag at start\n",
      "- Dice of your color score points equal to half their value rounded down.\n",
      "Comentario: Exactly what I want in a family weight dice drafting game. Turns are quick, looks great on the table, interesting enough choices while still being easy enough to teach to pretty much anyone.\n",

      "Comentario: Unlike Azul, this game is really satisfying as you get to actually complete your board. I like the symmetrical personal goals and the variety of shared goals. The tools are really interesting too. It makes the game play very different each time, yet it still feels really balanced. Just enough luck to avoid AP, yet plenty of interesting choices from the start. Sometimes things don't go your way, but that's often due to a choice made early on that restricts your options later.\n",
      "Comentario: So beautiful! Very light, but deserves some thought.\n",
      "Comentario: Gorgeous and thinky. A little trickier than Azul and not as easy to teach.\n",
      "Comentario: This is a thinky, puzzle-game that is a lot of fun and offers various levels of difficulty. I can pull out a couple boards and play multiple puzzles by myself and still have fun, but is even funner with others. This is a great dice drafting game, I would highly recommend it! And pick up the 5/6 player expansion to get more cards, more tools, more everything.\n",

      "Comentario: KS Edition\n",
      "Comentario: Sagrada is quite fantastic. A simple game to teach and play, but very thinky. One of the best in the \"super filler\" category. A game that everyone need to try and can be enjoyed by families and gamers alike.\n",
      "Comentario: nicely balanced game, I don't get the \"pretty\" comments I constantly see. I do find the game very fun, easy to bring to the table, and easy to teach. it would get a higher rating if it were able to handle more people.\n",
      "Comentario: Aesthetically a very beautiful game. A lot of thought was clearly put into the design of the components. This is a very easy game to teach, but is very strategic at the exact same time. If you have the chance, buying the 5-6 player expansion further enhances the experience both aesthetically with new components (dice box and dice rings) and also in regards to the game-play by speeding the game up by having certain dice preselected.\n",
      "Comentario: Such a nice and family friendly game\n",

      "Signed copy by Daryl Andrews at Dice Tower Con 2018\n",
      "Comentario: An interesting concept. It certainly can be intriguing to play, but it's very much dependent on how well people roll. When I tried it we had a serious problem trying to roll '5's which can lead to issues with completing the game.\n",
      "Comentario: Uno dei nostri preferiti!!! Non stufa mai!\n",
      "Comentario: Sagrada is a dice-drafting game that is great for players that are wanting to add a little complexity to their gaming experience. The rules are simple to learn, but has enough complexity that mastering the game takes a few plays. Players take turns drafting dice and placing them on their board, each with different placement restrictions. Dice cannot be placed near a die of the same color or number. Victory points are awarded for filling in your board, the amount of favor tokens remaining (based of your board's difficulty), bonus objectives and your secret color objective. A mild amount of planning is required to make sure that you don't block yourself from placing dice.\n",
      "Comentario: A nice light game that's great for a variety of types of gamers.\n",
      "I own both Azul and Sagrada and they are both great in their own regard. I prefer Azul, but my wife prefers Sagrada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where Azul is completely open-ended and has the simple goal of everyone filling out the same boards to the best of their ability, Sagrada is much more focused and has clear, defined goals. I enjoy the open-ended problem solving in Azul, but it can be difficult for my wife. However, she loves the more specific goals you are working toward in Sagrada.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only problem with this game is there can be a great deal of luck involved in the dice rolls. Sometimes you need one specific number and you just keep getting shafted by some bad rice rolls in tandem with an unfavorable draft order when the dice you're looking for finally shows up.\n",

      "There are very few window pattern cards in the base game, so I may need to get the 5&6 player expansion soon.\n",

      "Comentario: This has become a family favorite.\n",
      "Comentario: Azul-y\n",
      "Comentario: Luck of the dice draw too big a factor for 2-player games. Not as much a problem at higher player counts since more dice are drawn to choose from.\n",
      "Comentario: Great game: plays quickly but always interesting.\n",
      "Comentario: A light-weight but really entertaining game. Love how the different templates help each game feel like a new puzzle that needs to be solved.\n",
      "Comentario: Mary\n",
      "Comentario: Bought used\n",
      "Comentario: Like the game and theme. Helps that my wife and I actually visited the real thing. Also like all the colourful dice. Game looks lovely and fairly easy to play. The problem is every time I have played it someone (many times me) misplaces dice in their grid and you don't discover it until late in the game!\n",
      "Comentario: Brilliant game! Short setup, easy to explain, crunchy little decisions, 2 player takes 30 minutes. It should have won SdJ. This game is great to play even with non gamers. Not as cutthroat or punishing as Azul (which is also a very good game).\n",

      "Comentario: 8 with the expansion\n",
      "Comentario: My favorite game at the moment. Every die you draft has the opportunity to make or break you. Lots of planning ahead. Can’t recommend enough... plus it looks great!\n",
      "Comentario: One of the best made game I've played. Gameplay is never boring (even if you play 5th part one after another). It is sooo comfortable. Box isn't too big, every space was filled. The best thing for me was when I discovered that windows fits the bag perfectly, so you just need to slip the cards into it. I am waitind for the expansion to get some new goals and wait for another addons.\n",
      "Comentario: Nice looking dice drafting game. We enjoy building it so much. Player mat at the game end is fantastic.\n",
      "Comentario: Don't let this easy-to-teach game with its beautiful stained glass images and multi-colored dice fool you! This is a very fun puzzle that can become rather cutthroat. Lots of variety and options to handicap players of different skill levels.\n",
      "Comentario: There's something very addictive about forming patterns with the very pretty dice. Everyone who has played has wanted to play again. The only downside is that the dice are quite small and rounded so it's very easy to rotate them accidentally as you insert new ones into your grid. Not a game for clumsy or fat fingered players!\n",
      "Comentario: I admit, Sagrada was an impulse purchase. I thought it was pretty. This is what ya get when girls play boardgames LOL! Thankfully, it's a solid game with simple mechanics and thoughtful strategy. This falls into the category of puzzle games - kinda like Blokus or Patchwork. You have a limited choice of pieces (dice in this case) and you must place as many dice as you can on your own player grid, while following placement restrictions. There are favor tokens that you can spend to help you throughout the game. It consists of 10 rounds of dice-drafting, so it is fairly quick. It scales nicely as well, since you simply roll less dice for less players. I'll always play when presented with opportunity. 8/10.\n",
      "Comentario: A very solid game, very easy to learn, but gets really tight really fast. Decisions become hand-wringing, mind-wrenching conundrums. It’s a wonderful puzzle to solve.\n",
      "Comentario: German Version\n",
      "Comentario: One of my favorite games. It's easy to enough to teach new people quickly while offering plenty of depth for experienced players. I do love puzzles though, and at its core, that is what this game is. A very beautiful puzzle.\n",
      "Comentario: Fun, fast euro game.\n",
      "Comentario: I like it. It's pretty easy to make an error, though. I find that it feels a little brain-burny as a result. And not in a good way. It's not quite to Ricochet Robots-stage of headache inducing, but it still feels really tense. I think more like...say...playing Ingenious. You place something down and immediately need to check to make sure it's legal where it is.\n",

      "Comentario: Sudoku with colored dice! This is a game you can play with your grandparents but still have enough tactical depth thanks to the powers and objectives. Scales well with any number of players and plays a lot differently than other games in my collection, which is always a plus.\n",
      "Comentario: Plus 5/6 player expansion\n",
      "Comentario: Beautiful game, very eye catching. Easy to explain. Probably on a similar level to Century games in terms of gateway. The type of game that makes you want to play multiple times. Great variety in windows, but wish there were more end game scoring options.\n",
      "Comentario: This game looks amazing on the table. I enjoy the game play but find myself wishing there was just a bit more to it.\n",
      "Comentario: Really good game. Have played a number of times. Game is complex with the hard patterns and require a thoughtful planner. Clever game.\n",

      "I do wish that the point totals varied a bit more. Usually it is pretty close at the end, no matter what you do. There isn't a great way to pull ahead of your competition.\n",

      "Comentario: Incredibly thematic and pretty, Sagrada is a game where you draft coloured die to make a stained glass window. Players are dealt a backdrop that establishes the rules of your particular window, and then dice are chosen at random from a bag and rolled to establish where they can be placed. Resources can be spent on abilities that circumvent the normal rules. Sagrada is a lot of fun, and forces you to adapt to ever changing circumstances.\n",
      "Comentario: WAOW. Better than Azul . And so beautiful . My wife 'adore' this game .\n",
      "Comentario: Fun drafting mechanic, Beautiful game with vibrant colors. A unique theme that tied into the game well and no weird or dark elements which is always a plus in my book. Light but thought provoking, something that can be played with gamer and non gamer friends. The different cards that came out per game make for lots of replay-ability with different objectives. Game is very well done at the time of writing this is in my top 10. I highly recommend. I own the 5-6 player expansion but haven't tried it yet.\n",
      "Comentario: Plays fast, plays differently every single time, has a great expansion (with more inn the works), it's beautiful to behold, it challenges the grey cells. I love it!!!\n",
      "Comentario: Beautiful production. Makes the dice roll drafting mechanic a little more interesting. Very prone to AP though, especially towards the second half of the game. Kind of ambivalent on the tools, often seem to make things more complicated, almost want to take it out when teaching to non-gamers.\n",

Out of the games I'm waiting to receive from Kickstarter at the time of writing, I think this is the one that's the most different to anything else I have in my collection. I don't own a lot of games with dice, and definitely none that can be called dice-heavy. This has dice as the main component, but still uses them in a pretty new and innovative way. And it looks great!\n",

      "EDIT: After playing a few times solo and a few times with my wife, I can already say this is exactly what I hoped for. It's light but still thinky. It requires both strategy and luck.

It works very well at all player counts from two to four. I did like the solo variant, even though I found it very hard. I don't play solo very much though, so I haven't tried it any more since my last update.\n",
